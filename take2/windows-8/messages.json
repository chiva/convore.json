The one thing that's been keeping me from buying a tablet (iPad or otherwise) is because at present, despite all the cool stuff they can do, there's still just too much they can't do which I need my PC to be able to do.

I find it hard to predict the future of computing right now, with things being as in flux as they are, but it's possible that us who want a computer that \"does more\" than a locked-down tablet are destined to be an ever smaller niche audience.\n\nI mean, I don't know exactly what the things are that you want to do on the laptop that you can't do on an iPad (maybe you can list a few), but think about them for a minute: how many people out there (people like\u2026\u00a0your parents) actually need to do those things on a computer?
