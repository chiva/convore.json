Sources say that with Nintendo\u2019s art style and the power the system has, the games look \u2018stunning\u2019.\n    The system does run on AMD R700 card, but the architecture is slightly different and the clock speeds are much higher.\n    The System resembles JPN/EU SNES machines in color only and not in shape\n    The development kit is about the size of a 360, not the console\n    Close sources say it\u2019s as if Nintendo is in \u201cdamage control\u201d with 3rd party developers. Nintendo is trying really hard to get 3rd parties on board to develop games and have offered incentives such as not releasing big-title Nintendo games in holiday seasons to compete against 3rd party titles.\n    Nintendo went to many 3rd party developers on guidance on what they were after with the new console in terms of system specs, controller and online system.\n\nThe Controller:\n\n    Nintendo have been keeping this really quiet and have only given developers controller prototypes to start designing games. However, the final controller build with all the features have only been given to Nintendo 1st and 2nd party developers for now.\n    Nintendo had planned on inserting a screen on the controller back when the Gamecube was in development, but opted out due to technology not being advanced enough to be functional\n    The controller that\u2019s been given to developers has a large 5.7inch hd (960x640pixel) screen, 2 analogue sticks, 4 face buttons, 3 middle buttons (select/home/start in that order), 2 shoulder buttons and 2 triggers.\n    The triggers aren\u2019t as deep as the 360\u2019s triggers, but have plenty of push\n    The big thing about the screen is that it\u2019s a multi-touch screen, contains it\u2019s own battery and is detachable from the controller unit\n    The screen when detached contains its own memory so developers can store data on it, so gamers can play whatever the developer designs for the screen-only use\n    When the screen is attached to the controller it works by streaming content directly from the console\n    Nintendo are giving developers ideas other than just having it function as a quick menu screen for games while attached, or as a simple tamagochi-like mini-game when detached\n    The controller contains a gyroscope, but motion controls isn\u2019t the focus of the controller like it was for the Wii\n\nGames:\n\n    Nintendo will release a Mario platformer as a launch title which hasn\u2019t been done since the N64.\n    The Mario platformer looks to be the spiritual successor to Mario 64.\n    Gamefreak and EAD are hard at work developing a Pokemon online RPG.\n    The Pokemon RPG is not an MMO, but does have a large online emphasis and will be Nintendo\u2019s flagship title when showing off the online capabilities of the console.\n    There will be at least one new IP Nintendo will reveal at E3.\n    Nintendo is working on a new Zelda, but didn\u2019t reveal anything to developers.\n\nOther:\n\n    Some developers have had the Wii 2 dev kit for going on 2 years now. When the Wii 2 is released in late, that\u2019s 3 years to develop games on.\n    Because of such generous development time, Nintendo have pushed 3rd parties to develop high quality games to be released at or near launch.\n    Nintendo have sourced an external company to develop their online network, which the developer has commented, surpasses both the PS3 and 360 in terms of speed and functionality.\n    Nintendo is pushing for the console to be online 24/7 and have seamless online integration with many of their games\n    Friend codes are confirmed to be gone\n    Nintendo has been toying with the idea of a game where the main character is your Mii\n    Nintendo will be pushing their Pokemon RPG to showcase their online network\n    Rockstar are supposedly hard at work in bringing on of their \u201cmost popular\u201d titles to the console.\n\n\nI'm just going to go right ahead and call it the Dreamcast 2 :)", "group_id": 9493, "id": 1294636}, {"user_id": 31852, "stars": [], "topic_id": 38201, "date_created": 1307342977.4816511, "message": "New rumors suggest the system is to be called simply \"Nintendo\".
