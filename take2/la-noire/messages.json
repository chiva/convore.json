There have been various reports of this on a few different games now, all reporting their PS3s turning off or \"Red Lighting\" after having installed 3.61. This can range from games randomly freezing to PS3s turning off anywhere between 30 mins use to 2 hours.

The only aspects of LA Noire that I am finding to be excellent are the voice acting and the facial animations. But the gameplay is repetitive, contrived, rigid and half-baked. It's more like playing a guessing game than doing detective work in many cases. The main character is a dour jerk; that's fine, but give us some sympathetic or humorous hook if we must spend 30 hours with the guy. The writing is also just not quite good enough for the game's cinematic ambitions - it's decent for a videogame, but rather humourless and flat compared to its inspirations. I'm left wondering why I shouldn't be watching LA Confidential or Boardwalk Empire instead of watchign a game that is about on a par with Law & Order: Criminal Intent in its writing and plotting. And Bondi would've done itself a huge favour getting rid of its rather drab and empty open-world and focusing on mise-en-scene the way Heavy Rain did for each of its sequences. Action gameplay is weak, as well. It's worth seeing the facial animation technology and the game is a nice change of pace over most of the stuff we get from the big studios, but it's really not a 95% game, more a 70% one.
