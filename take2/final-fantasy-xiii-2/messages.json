More branching paths, more hidden secrets, more exploration.\n    Level design sees you returning to unlocked environments to access hidden areas as the game progresses.\n    A self-contained story set after the events of FINAL FANTASY XIII. XIII-2\u2019s story will be darker and more mysterious.\n    All-new playable characters (Serah and Noel), plus the return of fan favourites from FINAL FANTASY XIII.\n    The return of the much loved Moogle.
