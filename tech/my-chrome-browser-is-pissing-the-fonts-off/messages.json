The reason was a faulty graphics card driver.\n\nAnother time when I saw really ugly fonts w/ the same machine was a case of missing fonts. It won't bother you as long as a website is using some generic font, or does not assign any particular font for the text (which would be the ideal solution).  And, is using valid html and css.\n\nI didn't bother to look into the source of that site, but I'd guess you either have a missing font or a bug in the browser. Or perhaps a broken browser. I watched that page with Safari, which is using the same Webkit engine, and the site looked just fine. They do seem to use at least two different fonts in their styles.\n\nAs a first aid thing, I'd try upgrading the Chrome browser first, or deleting and re-installing it from scratch, or trying that particular page with another browser.  You could also check if you've got a newer graphics driver to install, and that you don't happen to miss any basic fonts, for some unknown reason. Provided that you're using Windows.\n\nSorry if I repeated someone else's suggestions, because it's hard to concentrate on reading the thread all the way through with all that bickering.", "group_id": 97, "id": 1558911}]
