We also have a lot of users who have Olark installed on their web site, which is a visitor chat service. Rather than write our own chat service, which is not really something we wanted to do, we decided to implement Olark chat right into Spy\nhttp://getclicky.com/blog/250/chat-with-your-visitors-from-spy \n \n\nSeems a neat idea \u2013 anyone here using it? How do your users react?", "group_id": 97, "id": 300778}]
