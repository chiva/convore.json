Our algorithm resolves pixel-scale features in the input  and converts them into regions with smoothly varying shading that are crisply separated by  piecewise-smooth contour curves.\n\nIn the original image, pixels are represented on a square pixel lattice, where diagonal neighbors are only connected through a single point. This causes thin features to become visually disconnected under magni\ufb01cation by conventional means, and creates  ambiguities in the connectedness and separation of diagonal neighbors. The key to our algorithm is in resolving these ambiguities. This enables us to reshape the pixel cells so that neighboring pixels belonging to the same feature are connected through edges,  thereby preserving the feature connectivity under magni\ufb01cation. We reduce pixel aliasing artifacts and improve smoothness by \ufb01tting spline curves to contours in the image and optimizing their control points", "group_id": 12, "id": 1215017}, {"user_id": 719, "stars": [], "topic_id": 37212, "date_created": 1306624240.7105899, "message": "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart/paper/pixel.pdf", "group_id": 12, "id": 1215018}, {"user_id": 39287, "stars": [{"date_created": 1315665857.2841439, "user_id": 719}], "topic_id": 37212, "date_created": 1315381721.6092839, "message": "Missed that one!
