We propose two strategies for improving overall availability using simple mechanisms that scale over large applications whose output behavior tolerates graceful degradation. We characterize this degradation in terms of harvest and yield, and map it directly onto engineering mechanisms that enhance availability by improving fault isolation, and in some cases also simplify programming. By collecting examples of related techniques in the literature and illustrating the surprising range of applications that can benefit from these approaches, we hope to motivate a broader research program in this area.\"", "group_id": 12, "id": 43883}, {"user_id": 230, "stars": [{"date_created": 1296714100.3791969, "user_id": 1}], "topic_id": 1661, "date_created": 1296713406.364336, "message": "This one's a personal favorite: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.24.3690&rep=rep1&type=pdf", "group_id": 12, "id": 43882}]
