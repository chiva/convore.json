Supporting range query over Peer-to-Peer systems has attracted many research e\ufb00orts in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new multidimensional indexing structure for P2P systems called Distributed Hilbert R-trees (DHR-trees). DHR-trees enables multidimensional range query to be executed similarly as in overlapping regions tree in P2P systems. Its distributed structure makes it fault-tolerant and scalable to dynamic network environment with a large number of peers as well. Our experiments shows that it performs well on multidimensional range query while the maintenance cost is reasonably low.", "group_id": 12, "id": 610351}, {"user_id": 2557, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302452530.8611701, "message": "Broken link?", "group_id": 12, "id": 610474}, {"user_id": 1060, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302455914.8642321, "message": "The R*-tree became the de facto multi-dimensional index in many RDBMSes", "group_id": 12, "id": 611314}, {"user_id": 1060, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302455961.543267, "message": "The authors of the R*-tree have a revised design: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1559845.1559929", "group_id": 12, "id": 611339}, {"user_id": 1060, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302455796.4635799, "message": "There have been some interesting improvements on the original R-tree recently", "group_id": 12, "id": 611264}, {"user_id": 1060, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302456069.5391531, "message": "Not sure however how amenable the R*-tree is to a distributed environment", "group_id": 12, "id": 611369}, {"user_id": 1060, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302456043.9052639, "message": "They improved concurrency and query performance", "group_id": 12, "id": 611364}, {"user_id": 11, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18377, "date_created": 1302543423.0502551, "message": "We've had problems with r-trees in general in a distributed environment.
