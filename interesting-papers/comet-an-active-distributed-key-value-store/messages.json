Our research seeks to greatly expand the application space for key-value storage systems through application-speci\ufb01c customization. We designed and implemented Comet, an extensible, distributed key-value store. Each Comet node stores a collection of active storage objects (ASOs) that consist of a key, a value, and a set of handlers. Comet handlers run as a result of timers or storage operations, such as get or put, allowing an ASO to take dynamic, application-speci\ufb01c actions to customize its behavior. Handlers are written in a simple sandboxed extension language, providing properties of safety and isolation.\nWe implemented a Comet prototype for the Vuze DHT, deployed Comet nodes on Vuze from PlanetLab, and built and evaluated over a dozen Comet applications. Our experience demonstrates that simple, safe, and restricted extensibility can signi\ufb01cantly increase the power and range of applications that can run on distributed active storage systems. This approach facilitates the sharing of a single storage system by applications with diverse needs, allowing them to reap the consolidation bene\ufb01ts inherent in today\u2019s massive clouds.", "group_id": 12, "id": 743250}]
