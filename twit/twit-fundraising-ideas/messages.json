Each of the hosts would do a 1.5 hour show that is divided into 18 five minute segments. The segments will be a Skype-In question from a patron/bidder. Some hosts would cost more than others and some shy hosts could double up. I think we could have Leo, Tom, Eileen, Jason, Sarah, Dick, Amber, iYaz, Becky, Lisa JERRI, Andy & Alex, Brian, Jeff & Gina, tha't's all I can think of at the moment, that is 14 shows. 14 x 18 segments is 252 segments. With an average price of $400 that could yield $100,000.
