I'm also interested to see what the new HP/Palm line will be like, as a whole.\nVery cool photo of a nearly 100-yo old Harley.\n\nActually, I used to hate all the phone cameras or camera phones earlier, but at least now iPhone and some other Android phones have pretty cool photo apps that make them much more interesting and useful.\n\n@HateBadDesign Well, based on the comments over there, I wouldn't be too sure about it. ;) \nBTW, I was just being sarcastic, you now.
