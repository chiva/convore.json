In theory this should ease the workflow. In practice though I think it's not sustainable because a developer wants to change the code wherever he wants, whenever he wants. That's what he can do when the team is working with a repository. Besides that , each ruleset execution has a cost ( http://kynetx-images.s3.amazonaws.com/KynetxPricingVARS%20March%202010.pdf ). While I understand that an app that uses more server ressources should naturally cost more, just making an app more readable by splitting it in rulesets shouldn't or we will end up developping tools that take several rulesets and stick everything in one. Yes there are modules ( =reusable functions) but they don't achieve what a ruleset  or a rule can do. I'd rather suggest ( but I am sure that is already on your long todo list ) some common things found in other languages like file inclusions ( of KRL code) , constants ( not vars) or the possibility to use the \"use ressource\" directive inside rules by adding a meta block in rules so the resource only gets loaded when needed.
