Sometimes it\u2019s from 1 gem being updated and another not being updated. Other times it\u2019s from gems that don\u2019t have https support. To top it all off I notice that some of the gems have pull requests that the owner isn\u2019t pulling. \n\nSo I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve basically had to hack away at the gems to get them to work. If I ever did a pull I\u2019d nuke all my changes and be back at square 1 (I\u2019ve backed up my changes, but I don\u2019t want to go edit my gems every time I update). I COULD just keep local copies, but I feel that defeats the purpose of gems.\n\nI recently pulled an item (activesp) which seemed to have many versions of custom gems:\nFetching: xaop-ntlm-http-0.1.1.2.gem (100%)\nFetching: savon-xaop-0.7.2.7.gem (100%)\nFetching: activesp-0.1.0.gem (100%)\nsavon and ntml have \u201cofficial gems\u201d but \u201cxoap\u201d looked to be in the same position as me and had to make modifications and just create their own gems. I\u2019d do this also, but it seems like it\u2019s just going to dirty up the gem pool.\n\nI can\u2019t really think of a solution other than what \u201cxoap\u201d did. What do you guys do at work?
