I've been doing a lot of research lately and there are plenty of resources on building an accurate replica of the movie props, including a a good number of people machining parts. I am not content just making a recreation that sits on display or functions as an elaborate costume accessory. Any ideas on how I can make it functional? Since it is supposed to be a \"particle accelerator\" I've considered using it to accelerate projectiles like paintballs or airsoft pellets.  Heck, silly string could be cool. There are a lot of possibilities as it is simply a pack connected to a wand via hose. Maybe I can have to geekiest leaf blower?", "group_id": 8728, "id": 685953}, {"user_id": 29165, "stars": [], "topic_id": 19416, "date_created": 1302826273.897531, "message": "How about pressurized foam like material used by fire depts.
