The sessions are noted <a href=\"http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=9a554&t=9a554.40&f=9a554.4e364d\">here</a> prior to the conference but also posted on a huge posterboard during the day for anyone to tack up a notecard with a session on the rooms & time slot grid. Last year I sat in on a great discussion and sessions from housing potential and issues with foreclosed homes, using RFID to share tools in a neighborhood, to a github and XP overview, and learned of the new Makerspace in Madison <a href=\"http://www.sector67.org\">Sector67</a>. Web development is a common thread.\n\nThere are usually at least 5 concurrent sessions, from 30 to 90 minutes, and run from morning until evening.\n\nI did not attend <a href=\"http://barcampmilwaukee.com/blog\">Milwaukee BarCamp</a>, but hope to this year.  It \nis happening October 1-2.  Last year featured electric car conversion projects, Mono on Android, a Scrum experience report, and of course Web and mobile development technologies, and even sessions on Sunday for children.
