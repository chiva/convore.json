Like many others, I haven't studied CS and I probably lack knowledge of many important terms. However, while working with various server-side languages (Ruby, Python) I have gathered quite some understanding on OOP and so JS implementation of OOP (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism etc.) is clear enough for me. I am also aware of \"procedural\" style of programming which is what (if I understand it right) most of the \"jQuery\" developers do (no offense to people who love jQuery, I'm aware of that you can write professional code with it, I am just giving a broad reference to copy-paste developers) and which is what I've been mostly doing up until I've started to learn JavaScript in a more serious fashion.", "group_id": 160, "id": 1110121}, {"user_id": 1516, "stars": [{"date_created": 1305818820.4214511, "user_id": 26065}, {"date_created": 1306737698.9365461, "user_id": 16058}], "topic_id": 35932, "date_created": 1305801299.843365, "message": "the idea behind functional programming is that you avoid mutable state (modifying variables etc.) but rather emphasize application of functions", "group_id": 160, "id": 1110185}, {"user_id": 1101, "stars": [], "topic_id": 35932, "date_created": 1305801616.0863309, "message": "So you can kind of mix OOP with functional programming?", "group_id": 160, "id": 1110199}, {"user_id": 1101, "stars": [], "topic_id": 35932, "date_created": 1305801791.522655, "message": "thanks a lot, this comparison between imperative and functional makes things more clear for me.", "group_id": 160, "id": 1110213}, {"user_id": 1101, "stars": [], "topic_id": 35932, "date_created": 1305800634.979018, "message": "I've seen \"underscore.js\" and I'd like to ask what this \"t that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in Prototype.js (or Ruby)\" mean?
