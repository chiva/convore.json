Restaurant is small in the style of Antico Pizza, but they have great BBQ.  At least one of the owners is Korean, so they also have a number of sides and specials with a Korean twist.  They're absolutely packed during weekday lunches.", "group_id": 707, "id": 63852}, {"user_id": 2008, "stars": [], "topic_id": 3135, "date_created": 1297350430.566818, "message": "Agreed.", "group_id": 707, "id": 70218}]
