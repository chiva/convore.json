Specifically:\n\n\"Then the LORD said to Samuel, \"Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them. Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli\u2019s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.\" 1 Sam 3:11-14\n\nSeems Eli's sons had pushed God too far. And now there was no hope for their atonement. So the question is this:\n\nIs there a limit to God's Grace? \nAnd does this limit apply only to non-believers?", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1417467}, {"user_id": 13817, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39629, "date_created": 1308569498.8734291, "message": "I would say yes. There is a limit. If we look at the OT, God seems to have patience and grace and then because of the harness of hearts and the depravity of their beings He punishes them. Often it is said that the OT God seems a lot harsher than the loving NT God.\n\nI heard (not sure where now) that the OT is written over a lot longer period than the NT. So God has grace and patience and love but then we see people get punished. Where as the NT is over a period of something like 70 odd years. So there is not a lot of time there but it does promise a time of judgement.", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1437703}]
