Hebrews 6:4-6. Now, I'll start with the calvinist/once saved always \nsaved defense. The idea is that each individual description isn't conclusive \nin proving that the author is talking about true Christians. They will cite \nSaul who had the spirit of God and spoke by it, but was not saved. And they \nwill say that partaking of any of these things was a by product of being in \ncommunity with other believers. But for me, since the author didn't just \nmention one description of who he was talking about but 7 different \ndescriptions. Let's enumerate using the ESV (one of my favourite more word \nfor word translations);\n\n1. those who have once been enlightened\n2. who have tasted the heavenly gift\n3. have shared the holy spirit\n4. tasted the goodness of the word of God\n5. and the powers of the age to come\n6. and then have fallen\n7. restore again.\n\nOne of the arguments is that tasting the heavenly gift is akin to the\n nonstarters in the sewn seed parable, but then the author goes on to \ninclude tasting the goodness of the word of God, which therefore makes \nthe first idea rather moot. The combination of all of those idea's seems \npretty sufficient evidence that the author is not speaking of non-Christians. \nOtherwise it seems to be quite a bit of overkill. The idea that they be \nrestored AGAIN to repentance? You can repent more than once? The author\u2019s \npoint is either that it is impossible for someone to be a true Christian, \nreject God and then return to salvation, or his point is that it is impossible \nfor someone to fake being a Christian, to not truly be saved, then turn his \nback and then become either A: a fake Christian Or B: a real Christian. So\n by once saved always saved interpretation the author is saying false \nChristians can never turn away from their empty professions, and return \nto them or they can\u2019t turn away from their empty misunderstood professions \nand then at a later stage receive true repentance. Which seems unlikely. \nThe more likely here is that the author means a person cannot return to \nChristianity once they reject it, which is why it says \u201creturn to repentance\u201d.\n John Wesleys notes on the text seem to agree. \n\n\u201cWith the light of the glorious love of God in Christ. And have tasted the \nheavenly gift - Remission of sins, sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. And\n been made partakers of the Holy Ghost - Of the witness and the fruit of he \nSpirit.\nHave had a relish for, and a delight in it. And the powers of the world to \ncome - Which every one tastes, who has an hope full of immortality. Every \nchild that is naturally born, first sees the light, then receives and tastes \nproper nourishment, and partakes of the things of this world. In like manner,\n the apostle, comparing spiritual with natural things, speaks of one born of \nthe Spirit, as seeing the light, tasting the sweetness, and partaking of the \nthings \"of the world to come.\"\nHere is not a supposition, but a plain relation of fact. The apostle here\n describes the case of those who have cast away both the power and the form \nof godliness; who have lost both their faith, hope, and love, Heb_6:10, &c., \nand that wilfully, Heb_10:26. Of these wilful total apostates he declares, \nit is impossible to renew them again to repentance. (though they were renewed\n once,) either to the foundation, or anything built thereon. Seeing they \ncrucify the Son of God afresh - They use him with the utmost indignity. \nAnd put him to an open shame - Causing his glorious name to be blasphemed.\u201d", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1343031}, {"user_id": 13817, "stars": [], "topic_id": 36170, "date_created": 1308046799.5136681, "message": "I think the tough thing in all this is to make sense of it all.
