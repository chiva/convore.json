Remember that the origin of the curse is the disobedience to the Word of God. That is why we are advised to be watchmen over our personal, family, neighbourhood, city, national and global gates. Personal gates are the most crucial gates. Personal gates consist of the gate of the eye, the gate of the ear, the gate of the mouth, the gate of the heart and the gate of the sexual organs. Just look at David; a good example of how curses can be transmitted, to the next generation just because he failed to properly mend his gates, the gate of the eye and the gate of the sexual organs. The weakness(curse) concerning women started with David and Solomon inherited the same curse, which led to his downfall. David's great grandfather (Boaz), grandfather (Obed) and his father (Jesse) didn't have a weakness for women. So this curse started when David decided to look at Bathesba with lust instead of joining other men in the war (instead of joining other men in prayer), which led to the gate of the sexual organs opening up and eventually murder was committed. Most people fail to grasp that a sexual act is more than just a physical act; it is more spiritual than just physical. It is a joining of spirits into becoming one. Anyway that is another topic for another day. It is vital that we properly guard our personal gates. Once the personal gates are closed; the enemy will not have a foothold over one's life.\nMay 1 at 5:07pm \u00b7 Like \u00b7  1 person\nMandy Nompumelelo Mtyelwa it becomes easier to mend other gates such as family, neighbourhood, city etc, if personal gates are tightly closed.\nMay 1 at 5:11pm \u00b7 Like \u00b7  1 person", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1070289}, {"user_id": 32900, "stars": [], "topic_id": 35160, "date_created": 1305551219.9241469, "message": "@LintonCaldecott Opening and closing gates gave me COMPLETELY the wrong mental image.....thanks a lot!", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1070429}]
