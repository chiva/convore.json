I have one problem with Convore - it's perfect for reactive usage and weak for proactive. By reactive I mean reading logs of lets say \"conversations\". Proactive means having a conversation. Chat means I write something and I get answer within 10-15 seconds. Waiting more ends a conversation, at least if you define it as real-time. Current formulat of Convore would end in spam if we had here 2000 active users instead of 12, I'm affraid.", "group_id": 142, "id": 1303077}, {"user_id": 4149, "stars": [], "topic_id": 2198, "date_created": 1306568668.7023189, "message": "@equinox it was fun for awhile but I went back to irc and really just it on my phone but it is a strong platform and maybe with a little open source TLC could be an amazing software package", "group_id": 142, "id": 1211628}, {"user_id": 1, "stars": [], "topic_id": 2198, "date_created": 1297287844.5430319, "message": "@equinox We're still really small, just a three-person team right now.
