The new queue seemed to work great but it seems to be failing processing galleries of images. A typical example would be: 75 images in a zip file, Celery processes 72 of them and then stops. No errors or anything like that, just stops. If another gallery or task comes it, it'll process that one (stopping randomly if it's another gallery, of course). Any ideas?
