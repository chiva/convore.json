One of the first things I've noticed is that when ordering by one of my fields (a simple 'full name' field) the results don't seem to make sense. Initially I thought maybe the problem was that the field was being tokenized and the tokens were being evaluated independently of the entire list.. but I replaced-in underscores for the spaces and still see results that aren't making sense to me. The solr & haystack docs didn't seem to shed light on the subject, but I'm sure I'm missing something obvious..
