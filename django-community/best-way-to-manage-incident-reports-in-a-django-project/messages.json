I think this is a very common feature in a webapp. I need things like being able to customize my report forms, the user can follow discussion, needs to be private for the user, etc.\nI have looked into django-helpdesk, great app, but the API and some other things are not very well documented and it needs a little bit of work.\nWhat do you guys use? Is there an easy to integrate web service? should I just embrace django-helpdesk?", "group_id": 81, "id": 644505}]
