I know the detailed talk schedule isn't yet ready, but do we know when some of the macro-level items will be occurring (e.g. onsite registration, the start of the program, the end of the program, sprints, etc). Also, it's unclear from the site whether sprints will are included in the two days of actual conference, or whether they might extend after the conference has officially closed (like at PyCon). I suspect that it's the former and not the latter, but I'm not 100% sure.", "group_id": 8422, "id": 1393877}, {"user_id": 7548, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39375, "date_created": 1311888032.4949341, "message": "I appologize for answering this so late, I missed the notification.", "group_id": 8422, "id": 1742692}, {"user_id": 7548, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39375, "date_created": 1311888083.216615, "message": "The schedule is here: http://pyohio.org/schedule/\n\nSprints will be Saturday and Sunday after the conference, and Monday all day.
