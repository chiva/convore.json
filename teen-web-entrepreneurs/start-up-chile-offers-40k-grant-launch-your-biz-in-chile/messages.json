I am currently living in Chile and developing immersion based entrepreneurship and social innovation programs for high schools across the country. I encouraged and supported 3 young entrepreneurs who I coach to apply to the program (all of them are apps developers). And all of them were accepted (out of nearly 500 applicants) and are the youngest participants in the program (1 teen from Bosnia/Sarajevo, 1 from India and one 21 year old from Austin, TX). They accept 100 entrepreneurs into the program each quarter. If chosen, you will receive a $40k grant (money that does not have to be repaid); Coaching and incubation services; 6 months free office space and of course you get to meet me....priceless! In exchange you have to come and bootstrap your startup in Chile for 6 months. While I am not a participant of the program, I encourage young entrepreneurs from around the world to apply. Next round of apps should be opening in June. Hope to see you in Chile. Saludos!", "group_id": 513, "id": 1024682}]
