Imagine for example that the player does something dangerous on jungle island while exploring off the path; this could be anything from swimming near the Wahrk Gallows or eating a piece of poisonous fruit.  Something totally unexpected could happen as a consequence.  Instead of dying, the player might wake up several hours later in a hut in the jungle village having been rescued by one of the Rivenese natives.  The player could then easily explore the jungle village among the natives and get to experience another perspective of Riven and Rivenese culture.  Just saying.
