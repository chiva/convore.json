In 1958 the state of California took the property in Studio City, CA where Toto was buried. Toto was buried on he property of her trainer, Carl Spitz. The property was destroyed and everything on it, including Toto's grave site. We have a cemetery and a monument company in the works to make this happen. We think this is a very special dog and very special American cultural gem. We need to give Toto a proper thank you with this memorial. Come help and join the cause. It's completely non-profit. http://on.fb.me/h2N81S", "group_id": 5614, "id": 258722}, {"user_id": 17551, "stars": [], "topic_id": 10432, "date_created": 1299142404.528743, "message": "http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS1-Db1iqRai6bhOBDevevjmURseDBFKunUmiI74kC9EVVluWG-6A", "group_id": 5614, "id": 259142}]
