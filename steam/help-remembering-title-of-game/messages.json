It was to a multiplayer game with one or small team vs a larger team, the larger team was to be AI mostly but humans were able to jump in and out as needs be, a lot of fan fare was made of it but also got a lot of critics claiming it would be a grief fest, I wanna say the setting was Templar/Knight type fighting, but I can't remember fully. My google-fu is weak with this one and can't seem to find any info on it.", "group_id": 2186, "id": 804329}]
