Would be cool if listings came in real time.  Give enough time to click on link to find event.  I realize this is early, but I posted an event in Foxborough, Ma but could not find it after it was listed.  Could be broken link?  Focus on a major city first like Boston, New York or San Francisco to put out fliers about the site.  Once it takes off in that city, others will follow through word of mouth.  Looks good so far.", "group_id": 397, "id": 2079955}, {"user_id": 31226, "stars": [], "topic_id": 45045, "date_created": 1315580534.0290051, "message": "Energypanacea - Thanks for the feedback!!! I can see the problem on your event and it is with our date selection. There are certain things you can enter into the event date field that will cause the date to default to: Nov 30th 1969 (odd I know), we are working to clean that up now...", "group_id": 397, "id": 2085002}]
