Firing the entire coaching staff, except for the line coach who took over the HC job. Now looking forward Tennessee is set to rebuild. Though the Collective Bargaining Agreement is making their building process that much more difficult, the Titans are still in need of a QB for the future. So I ask y'all who do you think the Titans bring in to lead the team? Do they draft a rookie & hope he steps up? Or go with a tenured veteran? Or an unproven back like Alex Smith or Kevin Kolb? What is the future of the Titans franchise?", "group_id": 533, "id": 74771}]
