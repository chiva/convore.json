(and I wish I could code!) but I work for this site and we'd be so psyched if you guys wanted to explore our dataset: http://www.eol.org/  We aggregate biodiversity data from other online and offline sources (with detailed attribution, all Creative Commons.) One webpage per animal/plant/fungus/microbe/etc > 2 million pages these days. We don't have everything that's out there, but at this point we have way more than any other single source, so you could learn something about the state of biodiversity knowledge or literacy from our dataset. APIs are here: http://www.eol.org/content/page/api_overview .  Our stuff is not always so easy to navigate so contact me if you're interested but can't make head or tail of it.
