I recommend having a simple clean landing page that showcases what features make you different from the competition. The lettering of the name is spaced poorly as well, making it very hard to just read. Try using a more modern design approach as well. You should also have an ICO, programs to help make them are quick to download and very easy to use, with programs being replaced by tabs on browsers you are going to want users to recognize your tab by logo alone. Links underneath the \"logo\" don't work due to the logo overlapping them. And to be honest, I couldn't figure out what the site was for until I hit the small print at the bottom.", "group_id": 1701, "id": 149518}, {"user_id": 12133, "stars": [], "topic_id": 6510, "date_created": 1298312693.3732629, "message": "thanks for the comments", "group_id": 1701, "id": 160645}]
