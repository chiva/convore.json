They seem to use whatever release date they have for the CD for the music's release date and the info is simply lifted from AMG..  Also, I searched for \"Dream Weaver\" by Gary Wright.  The first result was a re recording even though they had the original album.  Hopefully it will get better with time.", "group_id": 87, "id": 557927}]
