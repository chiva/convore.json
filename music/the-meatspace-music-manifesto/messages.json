Interesting. I've heard a lot of crazy music manifestos. (\"i will only allow myself to listen to this song once before deleting the mp3, to force myself to really listen\"), but this is by far the most restrictive. Not aesthetically, but socially. It's like saying \"i will only use software written by people I know.\" It incentivizes you to know really musical people. Or... maybe you already know too many musical people, and this was a cool way to feel less overwhelmed? You gotta share the backstory of this. :D", "group_id": 87, "id": 319584}, {"user_id": 1661, "stars": [], "topic_id": 12188, "date_created": 1299834265.8476479, "message": "I've never met a rockstar I liked.", "group_id": 87, "id": 320701}]
