What other music forums fo you frequent and why?  For me, it's the Steve Hoffman forums.  There is some snooty audiophile talk but most people are civil.  It's well moderated and has other areas for video and off topic discussion.  Steve Hoffman became well known for mastering the gold DCC discs back in the 90s and most of the forum members love everything he masters and criticize some mastering techniques, particularly loudness and compression, with the extreme refereed to as \"brickwalling\" where the waveform visually resembles a solid brick wall.\nhttp://www.stevehoffman.tv/forums/index.php", "group_id": 87, "id": 343812}]
