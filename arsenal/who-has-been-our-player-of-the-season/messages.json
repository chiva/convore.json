Nasri a close second. Many others were brilliant in patches, but suffered absence due to injury.  I think Djourou stands out the most in that respect.  He had a real break-out season, and if he can stay healthy next year I think he could be the imposing CB we've been needing.  Szczesny too, but most of his \"absence\" was because he only really broke through in mid-season.", "group_id": 858, "id": 721464}]
