Starting off so well, we took the lead and then Messi showed up. But, what the score-line, or performance, doesn\u2019t tell you, is about the team we sent over there. Unlike Spurs, who are without (possibly) three players and it\u2019s a \u2018crisis\u2019 as they head to Milan, we were without Fabregas, Song, Gallas, Van Persie, and Arshavin. We went to Barcelona and played Silvestre. Silvestre! Our bench consisted of Fabianski, Eboue, Eastmond, Campbell, Traore, Merida, and Eduardo.\n\nEven on their best days, to start a team at the home of the Barcelona Globetrotters which includes Almunia, Silvestre, Denilson, and Bendtner, and to only leave with a three goal deficit is some sort of miracle. This was my preview from last season.\n\nCould Man United do any better out there without Vidic, Fletcher, Scholes, Rooney (on last season\u2019s form) and Nani? What about Chelsea without Terry, Essien, Lampard, Drogba, and Anelka? What if they had practically zero fit first-team players for the bench? You can be dam sure you would hear about it more than you did in the lead up to our match their last season.\"", "group_id": 858, "id": 113419}, {"user_id": 6225, "stars": [], "topic_id": 6060, "date_created": 1297861899.593514, "message": "@uche Yeah LadyArse is right.
