We are curious if anyone else here seen a similar bug on their site. In our case, the size for titles should be consistent across sections. Look at the titles for the \"Variations\" and \"Translations\" boxes as an example. On the desktop, the font sizes are consistent. On mobile Safari, though, the font for \"Variations\" renders much larger than the font for \"Translations\" even though the applied CSS styles are identical. Any clues why?", "group_id": 24, "id": 489006}]
