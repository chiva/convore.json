I can hear music fine and when I turn on the speaker phone I can hear things.  But I can't hear anything in the earphone when someone calls me.  I tried turning the phone ON and OFF a couple of times, but that didn't make a difference.  Also did a search on the web and it mentioned that the iPhone 4 thinks headphones are still connected (even though they are not).  Some webpages suggested plugging headphones IN and OUT over and over until the problem goes away.  I've tried that a few times too, but still no sound.    Any ideas on how to fix this?
