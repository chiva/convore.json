One thing I miss though from the client is the ability to type in something like @week13 and not @done and have it filter all my tasks down. Willing to take a shot at creating that function though not familiar with vim syntax too much. Can anyone think of a similar plugin that allows something like :tpf @week14 and not @done and can point me to the source? I figure if I can get the basic boolean working the filtering should be easy.", "group_id": 100, "id": 514137}, {"user_id": 26653, "stars": [], "topic_id": 17009, "date_created": 1301831556.34551, "message": "Easy, as in...
