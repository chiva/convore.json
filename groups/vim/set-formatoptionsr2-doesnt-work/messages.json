I'm trying to make Vim to foolishly stop adding extra comment-headers when on a comment line and pression `o` to go into insert mode.\n\nThis is what I have in my .vimrc:\n\n\" Formatting\nset nowrap     \" No line wrapping.\nset linebreak  \" Wrap at word.\n\nset textwidth=80  \" Desirable text width. Used for text auto-wrapping.\nset formatoptions+=r,2  \" FIXME: Doesn't work, unless re-sourcing .vimrc. Enable comment leader insertion after hitting <Enter> in insert mode, and keep last line indentation. Disable all other format options. NOTE: Requires 'set autoindent'.\nset formatoptions-=o  \" Having/deleting this line doesn't help.\n\nset backspace=indent,eol,start  \" Enable backspace key. Erase previously entered characters in insert mode.\n\nset number \" Show line numbers.\nset numberwidth=5  \" Width of numbers column.\n\nAnybody know how to make this work? What am I doing wrong?", "group_id": 100, "id": 900695}]
