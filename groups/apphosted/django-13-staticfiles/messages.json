In settings.py, set the following: STATIC_ROOT='/data/static/' , STATIC_URL='/static/', ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX='/static/admin/', and make sure 'django.contrib.staticfiles', is in your installed_apps.  (If you are using another directory - such as <project>/static for additional media, add \"import os\" to your settings.py and add os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'static'), to your STATICFILES_DIRS.  Metro will automatically run \"manage.py collectstatic\" on deploy.  Once it's setup, anything placed in your static dirs will automatically be served via nginx.", "group_id": 5035, "id": 1141808}, {"user_id": 15517, "stars": [], "topic_id": 36310, "date_created": 1306070869.47753, "message": "I will post a link when the docs are updated with the tutorial...", "group_id": 5035, "id": 1141810}]
