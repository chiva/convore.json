I'm thinking middleman is perfect as most pages are static with just the occasional PHP snippet in a couple of pages.\n\nI'm thinking that I can have some pages as:\n\nsomepath/somefile.php.haml\n\nand others as\n\nsomepath/anotherfile.html.haml\n\nand deal with a little ugliness to get the php passed through (perhaps from partials?). I'm not adverse to writing a little extra code to ease the way, but would appreciate any hints on where to focus.\n\nI wonder if anyone else has faced this and has some tips?
