This is a great idea, nice job thinking of it.\n\nToday's talk is just going to be about the Ruby Programming Language (ruby-lang.org). I'm not going to discuss Ruby on Rails or any other big projects. I'm going to demonstrate that Ruby is great on its own and show you why the smart people behind Rails chose Ruby.\n\nWindows Users:\nI don't personally use Windows, but I believe that the RubyInstaller (http://rubyinstaller.org/) should be the quickest way to get started. Here's a direct link to the installer (http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/75127/rubyinstaller-1.9.2-p290.exe).\n\nMac/Linux:\nThe Ruby Version Manager (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com) is definitely the way to go. Here is a link to the installation page. (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/). Make sure you follow all the instructions all the way through. The bash script that downloads RVM is really slick. You'll be set up perfectly for all the stuff we talk about later in the semester.\n\nNow that you have Ruby installed, you'll be able to follow along with the talk or jump ahead and try things out yourself.", "group_id": 11802, "id": 2275045}, {"user_id": 2909, "stars": [], "topic_id": 46112, "date_created": 1317729682.9518859, "message": "I'm happy to help ahead of time, but I don't want to spend much time on installation during the meeting.", "group_id": 11802, "id": 2275046}]
