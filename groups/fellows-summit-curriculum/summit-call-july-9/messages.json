This included skills-based sessions, group projects, breakout discussions based on affinity, and the inspirational/goal-setting speaker.\n\u2022\tIdeally, people would like to see a mix of lectures and hands-on learning.  There was some debate as to whether or not a \u201ccase\u201d would be a good format, but general consensus came down to the thought that doing a team project or small-group exercise of sorts (example, working for an hour on a design problem, similar to last year) would be helpful as it creates a different sort of bond between fellows.\n\u2022\tSeveral people liked having a menu of skill sessions to choose from.  One recommendation was have three speakers and two sessions, so you could go to at least two of the three speakers.  \n\u2022\tPeople would like to see the ideas marketplace but would prefer that it not have the competitive aspect to it and rather just be a place for people to present what they are working on to spur conversation and connections later.\n\u2022\tSome folks would like to see a \u201cPoking Holes\u201d type event where two or three fellows present relatively full enterprise ideas and the audience gives feedback and suggestions.\n\u2022\tHave the inspirational/goal-setting speaker have time later in the day for people to have 15 minute one on one sessions.\n\u2022\tHave time to brainstorm solutions for problems that are common across enterprises.\n\n2.\tFormat of the Weekend\n\u2022\tPeople would like to see a session on Monday, especially for those who cannot make Saturday for religious reasons. \n\u2022\tMonday could potentially include a tour or doing fun things in DC.\n\u2022\t9 am start time both days (Paige advocates for 10 am on Sunday).  Ron would want it to go as late as possible.\n\u2022\tVisitors can come to the summit especially if they are important partners.  Open DC receptions to other partners.\n\n3.\tTopics:\n\u2022\tWhat is the role of government in fostering early stage innovation?\n\u2022\tScaling enterprises and the role of government\n\u2022\tWhere is the social sector now?

Some feedback and other quick ideas based on my read-through :: I like the personal finance suggestion from Ron and also the suggestion to do ideas marketplace not as a competition and more as a \"I need the next breakthrough\" rather than starting a company. It might be interesting to have a couplet of sessions that drive you to create a personal deliverable (i.e., something you've been working on, or have been meaning to start working on -- in my case, an updated cover letter) that you work on during the summit and have to share with your group after a working sessions during the day + a night on your own.
