Here's an idea I thought about on a methodology to create passwords based on it. Think of a word, let's say Leo's bad password \"Monkey\", add a 2 digit number like 46. So Monkey46 would sort of be the memorable hint. Then the actual password would be something like $$$$Monkey))))))46 - 4 Symbols padded in front, 6 Symbols padded behind. Then add the 46 for another hundred billion years of a unbrute forceable password. The only downside is forgetting the symbols you used for the padding.
