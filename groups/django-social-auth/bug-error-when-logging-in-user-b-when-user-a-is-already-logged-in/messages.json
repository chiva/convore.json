In my fix for this problem, I decided to log out user A before redirecting to Google. That is, in social_auth.auth_process, after retrieving a valid backend and before setting *any* session variables, I include the following code:\n\n    # if another is currently logged in, then log them out\n    user = request.user if request.user.is_authenticated() else None\n    if user:\n        logout(request) # deletes all session cookies", "group_id": 5196, "id": 1768884}, {"user_id": 20656, "stars": [], "topic_id": 43113, "date_created": 1313005065.5216169, "message": "This should be done in the view, it's not something on concern of the backends IMO, I'll submit a fix for it.
