That is Login vs New User... The reason is lets say I put a Login page, user goes there and currently connected from a different Facebook user (a friend logged in forgot, or simply a different account he has), He clicks login, boom a New User is created... Another case.. Lets say simply Site wants to stop accepting new Users.. But still wants to allow Social connects... Given case can not be accommodated, as any user with a different Social account will have an access to the site... in views I think Login should only login the User if there is an already associated Account for it, a new View \"newuser\" should be implemented (well both \"login\" and \"newuser\" is implemented, needs to be seperated) ... So that on Sign-up page, We use \"newuser\" method call, and in Login page or panel use \"login\".. if login Fails, Can redirect the user to Open a new account... It just be good to have this kind of seperation.. For some might say \"well its just simply \"connect\" yes I accept, u r actually just supposedly connecting using your already logged in account.. But it kind of beats the purpose of limiting creation of new users... or Login/Signup .... At least a Variable (STOP_NEW_USER_CREATION = True) can solve the issue of a site not wanting to accept more Users given time.", "group_id": 5196, "id": 1524309}]
