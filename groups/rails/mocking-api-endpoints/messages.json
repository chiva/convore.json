You can also use something like VCR or one of the few other systems for Rails testing that record real API usage and builds mocks or similar.

We do a bit of this with our iOS app, however, our iOS app is actually calling API's on our own Rails backend that is then mocking out third party API's it hits on behalf of the iOS app (e.g. iOS app calls in and says \"reserve x\" and our app uses third party to generate a piece of x, and we mock that out in test).", "group_id": 447, "id": 1113956}]
