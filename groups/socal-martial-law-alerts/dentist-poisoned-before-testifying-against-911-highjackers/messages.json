Graham said that he had met three of the 9/11 hijackers a year before the attacks at a home in Shreveport. He became suspicious of them (he thought they were planning attacks on nearby Barksdale AFB) and contacted the FBI. The man who hosted the hijackers in Shreveport was a Pakistani named Jamal Khan. In 2004, Khan pled guilty to hiding cash transfers to Pakistan, and in an unusual plea deal the government stated that nothing in this deal would absolve Khan from any future prosecution regarding the attacks of September 11.\r\n\r\nhttp://911blogger.com/news/2011-02-21/dentist-who-was-poisoned-death-testifying-against-911-highjackers", "group_id": 3920, "id": 206705}]
