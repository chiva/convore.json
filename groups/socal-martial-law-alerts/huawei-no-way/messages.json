No way, Committee on Foreign Investment CFIUS, Amerilink, People's Liberation Army,\r\n\r\n\u200e\"Chinese telecommunications giant... was rebuffed in its effort to sell vast quantities of equipment to Sprint Nextel--an American company that provides communication services to the DoD & other government agencies... the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) took a hard look at the proposal &, quite sensibly, rejected it on national security grounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unbeknownst to CFIUS at the time, Huawei was making another, unscrutinized & problematic investment in the US. It bought pieces of 3Leaf, a now-insolvent pioneer in 'cloud computing' technology, including intellectual property with obvious military applications. When this transaction serendipitously came to the Pentagon\u2019s attention, alarm bells went off.\"\r\n\r\n\"The more the American people know about Chinese enterprises like Huawei & the full extent of their efforts to penetrate the U.S. market (for example, for the purpose of acquiring technology, both legally & illegally) & the security implications of our relying upon their products & services, the better.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/33936", "group_id": 3920, "id": 245617}]
