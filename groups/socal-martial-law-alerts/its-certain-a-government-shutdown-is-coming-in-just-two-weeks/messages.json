But, as WaPo notes, the Senate is on break all next week, which means there will be just four working days to hammer out an agreement.\r\n\r\nThat is really unlikely, since Speaker Boehner has said his side won't even agree to very short-term stopgap measures, as has sometimes been done in the past.\r\n\r\nYes, this is happening.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/a-government-shutdown-is-coming-2011-2", "group_id": 3920, "id": 154664}]
