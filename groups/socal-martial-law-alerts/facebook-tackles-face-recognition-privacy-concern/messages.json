The deployment of \"Tag Suggestions\" technology -- designed to speed up the process of labeling friends in photos -- had renewed concerns about how the world's largest social network with 750 million members handles privacy. The technology scans newly uploaded photos, compares faces in those snapshots with previous pictures, then tries to match faces and suggest name tags. When a match is found, Facebook alerts the person uploading the photos and invites them to \"tag,\" or identify, the person in the photo. Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in a letter to Facebook last month that it compromised consumers' rights to privacy by analyzing faces in photographs posted on the website, then cataloging them.\r\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/26/us-facebook-idUSTRE76P58Z20110726", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1728284}]
