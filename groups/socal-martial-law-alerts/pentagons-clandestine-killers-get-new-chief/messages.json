Joseph Votel on the left.\r\n\r\nDo not expect to see his face again any time soon. An elite \u2014 and controversial \u2014 team of worldwide terrorist hunters just wouldn\u2019t be the same if its leader were in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon announced Wednesday afternoon that Votel will be the next commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, taking over from Adm. William McRaven and earning his third star. It\u2019s a job that Votel has a lot of familiarity with: he used to be the command\u2019s deputy leader before taking his current job as chief of staff for the U.S. Special Operations Command.\r\n\r\nPresident George W. Bush famously called JSOC, as it\u2019s known, \u201cawesome.\u201d No surprises why: Its secretive operations include capturing and killing high-value terrorists and insurgents.\r\n\r\nUnder its most famous leader, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, it got its highest-profile kill in June 2006, when it iced Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq. It also ran the notorious detention center near the Baghdad airport, Camp Nama, where there were repeated allegations of torture.\r\n\r\nThe sign on the entrance? \u201cNO BLOOD, NO FOUL,\u201d according to The New York Times.\r\n\r\nJSOC has increasingly been the tip of the military\u2019s spear. In Afghanistan, its commandos are the ones who kick in doors for the \u201cnight raids\u201d on Afghan homes, especially in the South and East, that have angered Hamid Karzai but form a critical part of Gen. David Petraeus\u2019 war plan.\r\n\r\nSometimes its operations go awry, as when an October 2010 rescue mission to free British aid worker Linda Norgrove from Taliban captivity ended up killing the hostage. The man U.S. Central Command tapped to investigate what went wrong? Joseph Votel.\r\n\r\nVotel also has a lot of familiarity with the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions that consume a lot of JSOC\u2019s time. Back in 2007, he was the deputy commander of Combined Joint Task Force 82, which operated along the border. That means unlike many commanders of the high-powered raiding unit, Votel has experience being a \u201clandowner\u201d \u2014 that is, a soldier who has to deal with an angered population after the raid team has packed up and moved out.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019ll have to deal as well with a very tired Special Operations community \u2014 a problem Votel\u2019s current boss, Adm. Eric Olson, identified last week in a speech. But JSOC doesn\u2019t get breathers: It\u2019s likely to expand operations in Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia and other parts of the world where the military wants terrorists dead without any fingerprints.\r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t expect Votel to give any press conferences about his work.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/02/pentagons-secret-killers-get-a-new-leader", "group_id": 3920, "id": 129202}]
