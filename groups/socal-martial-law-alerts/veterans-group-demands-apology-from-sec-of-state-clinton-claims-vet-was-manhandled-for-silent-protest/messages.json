Secretary Clinton never paused, continuing her speech lecturing other countries about the need to allow freedom of expression and dissent, while Mr. McGovern was hauled out in front of her.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGovern was later found to have his arm covered with bruises. The metal handcuffs were fastened so tightly that his wrists were cut and some blood flowed from the cuts.\r\n\r\nAfter being held by local police, McGovern was told he was being charged with disorderly conduct.\r\n\r\nWatch the incident in the video below.\r\n\r\nVeterans for Peace is demanding an apology from Secretary of State Clinton.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.skyvalleychronicle.com/BREAKING-NEWS/VETERAN-S-GROUP-DEMANDS-APOLOGY-FROM-SEC-OF-STATE-CLINTON-BR-Claims-vet-was-manhandled-for-silent-protest-596038", "group_id": 3920, "id": 147805}]
