The Executive Office of Public Safety has approved 27 grants totaling $500,000 to buy scanners for state police and 26 local departments. The purchases are on hold while state lawyers develop a policy for the use of a common state database all the scanners would feed.\r\n\r\nSome ALPR scanners already are deployed on Massachusetts roads. State police have two. Several cities use them for parking enforcement. Chelsea has four scanner-mounted cruisers.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1353264", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1696712}]
