iris scan information embedded in a bar code on the reverse of the card; various biometric information included invisibly in the card, including all 10 digits in fingerprints.\r\n\r\nEach card bears a unique personal ID number and a face photo designed to make sure that only the person to whom the card was issued can use the card.\r\n\r\nNext to the eagle symbol of Mexico at the top of the card, the card reads \"United States of Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nCritics in Mexico have charged that the Mexican effort to enroll school children in a national biometric personal identity database involves the early implementation of an incremental \"new world order\" plan designed to fit into initiatives designed under the Security and Prosperity Partnership to evolve the North American Free Trade Agreement into a continental or regional North American Union governmental structure.\r\n\r\nTrusted Travelers of North America\r\n\r\nWND previously reported that on Nov. 30, 2010, DHS Secretary Napolitano and Mexican Ministry of the Interior Secretary Jos\u00e9 Francisco Blake Mora signed an agreement expressing their intent to develop a Global Entry international trusted traveler pilot program between the United States and Mexico that Mexico estimated would allow 84 million Mexicans to apply for Trusted Traveler of North America biometric border pass cards for rapid entry into the United States.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, on Sept. 27, 2006, WND reported that the Department of Transportation acting through a Security and Prosperity Partnership \"working group\" was preparing to issue North American biometric border passes to Mexican, Canadian and U.S. \"trusted travelers,\" according to documents released to WND under a Freedom of Information Act request.\r\n\r\nThe agreement Napolitano signed with Mexico on Nov. 30 appears to bring the SPP working group \"trusted traveler\" commitment closer to fruition.\r\n\r\nAs described on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website, the Trusted Traveler Program allows applicants to receive a biometric border pass to facilitate cross-border travel, after undergoing a thorough background check against criminal, law enforcement, customs, immigration and terrorist files, including biometric fingerprint checks and a personal interview with a CBP officer.\r\n\r\nThe \"Trusted Traveler Network\" is more completely described on the \"Global Entry website maintained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.\r\n\r\n\"Global Entry is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low risk travelers upon arrival in the United States,\" the CBP website proclaims. \"Though intended for frequent international travelers, there is no minimum number of trips necessary to qualify for the program. Participants may enter the United States by using automated kiosks located at select airports.\"\r\n\r\nAs described on GlobalEntry.gov, the Global Entry kiosks look much like ATM machines placed to assist Trusted Travelers passing through U.S. ports of entry including airports:\r\n\r\nGlobal Entry kiosks under the Trusted Traveler program have been installed at the following 20 airports, according to the CBP website.\r\n\r\n    * Boston-Logan International Airport (BOS)\r\n    * Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport (ORD)\r\n    * Dallas/Ft. Worth International Airport (DFW)\r\n    * Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW)\r\n    * Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL)\r\n    * George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston (IAH)\r\n    * Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)\r\n    * Honolulu International Airport (HNL)\r\n    * John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York (JFK)\r\n    * Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)\r\n    * McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas (LAS)\r\n    * Miami International Airport (MIA)\r\n    * Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)\r\n    * Orlando International Airport (MC))\r\n    * Orlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB)\r\n    * Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)\r\n    * San Francisco International Airport (SFO)\r\n    * San Juan-Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport (SJU)\r\n    * Seattle-Tacoma International Airport-SeaTac (SEA)\r\n    * Washington-Dulles International Airport (IAD)\r\n\r\nNorth American continental logo\r\n\r\nWND also has reported that the Trusted Traveler of North America cards the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, is in the process of issuing are being branded, not with a map of the United States, but with a logo that depicts North America as a continent, with the borders between the U.S. and Canada and between the U.S. and Mexico conspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nIn a file on the CBP website that instructs applicants how to obtain a Trusted Traveler of North America biometric card, a generic sample of the Trusted Traveler card is presented, complete with the logo of North America in the upper right hand corner:\r\n\r\nThe CBP website defines NEXUS cards being issued by CBP as being \"WHTI-compliant [Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative] for land and sea travel, as well as air travel from airports using the NEXUS program\" designed to \"provide expedited travel via land, air or sea to approved members between the U.S. and Canada border.\"\r\n\r\nSearching the Canadian website for the Canada Border Services Agency, an adaptation of the generic Trusted Traveler card can be found for the NEXUS program:\r\n\r\nThe CBP website identifies the FAST Driver card as being a WHTI-compliant document \"for entry into the United States by land or sea\" that can afford \"expedited release to approved commercial truck drivers making fully-qualified FAST trips between the U.S. and Canada and the U.S. and Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nSearching the Canadian website for the Canada Border Services Agency, an adaptation of the generic Trusted Traveler card can be found for the FAST program:\r\n\r\nFAST, an acronym for \"Free and Secure Trade,\" is identified on the CBP website with a logo that includes the three flags of the North American countries \u2013 the United States, Canada and Mexico.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=263797", "group_id": 3920, "id": 129642}]
