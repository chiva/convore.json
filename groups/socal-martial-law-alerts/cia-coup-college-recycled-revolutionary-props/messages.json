Serbia\u2019s Otpor, or the \u201cresistance,\u201d was funded to the tune of millions by the US National Endowment for Democracy. Its signature clenched fist logo adorned flags, signboards, and t-shirts carried by the US State Department-laid astro-turf until the ousting of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in 2000.\r\n\r\nhttp://static.infowars.com/2011/02/i/rotator/20otpor.jpg\r\nCIA Coup-College: Recycled revolutionary\r\n\r\nThe exact same logo would turn up 11 years later across the Mediterranean Sea in the streets of Cairo, illustrating further the preposterous, foreign-backed nature of the Egyptian uprisings. Could it just be just a coincidence and Dr. Tarpley\u2019s take mere speculative conjecture? Not even close.\r\n\r\nAfter its success, Serbia\u2019s Otpor would continue receiving funds from the West and become a \u201cCIA-coup college\u201d of sorts, under the name CANVAS, or \u201cCenter for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies.\u201d It appears that after the Egyptian April 6 Youth Movement finished attending the US State Department funded confab in New York City in 2008, it would make a trip to visit CANVAS in 2009. From there, it took CANVAS\u2019s \u201ccurriculum\u201d and apparently their logo, and began assembling a US-funded mob in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAmongst CANVAS\u2019s current \u201cpartners\u201d are the Albert Einstein Institution, Freedom House, and the International Republican Institute (IRI). The IRI includes amongst its board of directors John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Brent Scowcroft. When John McCain says \u201cWe should have seen this coming,\u201d in regards to the unrest in Egypt, he obviously isn\u2019t talking about himself since he helped make it happen.\r\n\r\nSee with your own eyes, the absolutely shameless hoax foisted upon you, the general public, by your corporate owned mainstream media, the US State Department, and all the disingenuous leaders who have feigned ignorance and surprise over the premeditated and meticulously planned unrest still unfolding throughout the Middle East today, and NEVER believe a word they say again.\r\n\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DbJ7_ZGER20/TWAE1Hlx2pI/AAAAAAAAALY/k-cgCKo6J0Y/s400/FistWhere.jpg\r\nSerbia\u2019s US National Endowment for Democracy funded \u201cOtpor\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U51i8Q0y8eQ/TWAE01FWQsI/AAAAAAAAALQ/eh1wBqrLV4o/s1600/fistOtporWall2.jpg\r\nSerbia\u2019s \u201cOtpor,\u201d a model for future US-backed color revolutions.\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QzlHBWZXEzc/TWAEs8nN-6I/AAAAAAAAALI/pe9KSW7TBKg/s400/fistOtporWall.jpg\r\nSerbia\u2019s \u201cOtpor.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jM13mNe-Lfk/TWAEsnG_beI/AAAAAAAAALA/P-ltUzSWRDU/s400/FistOtporMob.jpg\r\nSerbia\u2019s \u201cOtpor,\u201d US ready-made mob.\r\n\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-idjX7KbCFwY/TWAEsutQuaI/AAAAAAAAAK4/Qap0ZVWMEXg/s400/FISTOtpor.jpg\r\nSerbia\u2019s \u201cOtpor\u201d or \u201cResistance.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LWmAqwHttH0/TWAEsc87J1I/AAAAAAAAAKw/mOK-67bzbJM/s400/fistEgyptStencil.jpg\r\nEgypt\u2019s \u201cApril 6 Youth Movement,\u201d note the EXACT same fist logo, most likely brought back from Serbia by April 6 members studying the CANVAS \u201ccurriculum.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EK2ooLmcweE/TWAEsUvGUjI/AAAAAAAAAKo/Mvtth8AHbEY/s400/FistEgyptRecycle.jpg\r\nEgypt\u2019s \u201cApril 6 Youth Movement\u201d recycling US-funded revolution \u201cprops.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cXi8C8jljs4/TWAEcnEQpSI/AAAAAAAAAKg/y8Qfkv0lNLY/s400/fistEgyptBanner.jpg\r\nEgypt\u2019s \u201cApril 6 Youth Movement\u201d banner with painted in Egyptian flag to give the \u201cOtpor-fist\u201d some local flavor.\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZqtFgO8xUww/TWAEcVenabI/AAAAAAAAAKY/MDklKJ_bbEI/s400/fistEgypt.jpg\r\nEgypt\u2019s \u201cApril 6 Youth Movement\u201d sporting yet another identical \u201cOtpor-fist.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jzDIKRFJTYc/TWAEcV5o4RI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/dOW3NWfr78U/s400/fistBahrain.jpg\r\nBahrain\u2019s \u201cYouth for Freedom\u201d may have attended the CIA-coup college as well. BBC\u2019s canonizing of Bahrain\u2019s protesters as heroes surely indicates establishment approval.\r\n\r\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3w3qKicjsJ4/TWAEcH_n7NI/AAAAAAAAAKI/lqEL3epUKsc/s400/FistApril6KnockOff.jpg\r\nEgypt\u2019s \u201cApril 6 Youth Movement\u201d witlessly displaying foreign funded propaganda as they prepare to overthrow their country\u2019s government and make way for a Soros-funded constitution.\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-njGlc9OJrlg/TWAEcEI8p6I/AAAAAAAAAKA/avYdfSDBnew/s400/fistApril6Egypt.jpg\r\nEgypt\u2019s \u201cApril 6 Youth Movement\u201d banner with a slight variation.\r\n\r\nA final note to consider is that CANVAS is on record in Foreign Policy magazine\u2019s article \u201cRevolution U,\u201d assisting the \u201cRose Revolution\u201d of Georgia, the \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d of the Ukraine, and is currently working with networks from Belarus, Myanmar (Burma) and 50 other countries. Taking a look at their activities and the overall globalist agenda, it is clear they are involved in regime change that will directly assist the globalists in their encirclement of Russia and China.\r\n\r\nJohn McCain went on to say of the unrest his IRI had helped fund in Egypt, \u201cI would be a little less cocky in the Kremlin with my KGB cronies today if I were Vladimir Putin. I would be a little less secure in the seaside resort [of] President Hu and a few men who govern and decide the fate of 1.3 billion people.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcCain\u2019s careless comments, begotten of either senility or the utter contempt he holds the general public in, let slip the true nature of the game being played out via US-fueled color revolutions unfolding around the world. Indeed, this is about exacting concessions and forcing the integration of sovereign nations into the Anglo-American, unipolar world empire.\r\n\r\nhttp://dprogram.net/2011/02/20/cia-coup-college-recycled-revolutionary-%E2%80%9Cprops%E2%80%9D", "group_id": 3920, "id": 155552}]
