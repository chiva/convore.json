This is what we\u2019ve allowed the mainstream media to get away with by feeding us such deceptive hocus-pocus that we accept this party line.  In Seattle and Oakland, John T. Williams and Oscar Grant were both murdered in cold blood with witnesses present and with video evidence; their precious lives brutality taken by the hands of police officers.  The outcome?  One officer received an extremely short prison sentence and the latter got away scot-free.   As retired Army Officer and former CIA agent Ray McGovern briefly stated this week as the goon squad brutalized him for silent protest, \u201cSo this is America.\u201d  Yes Mr. McGovern, this is now America indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more ridiculous about this recent event surrounding the John T. Williams case is that the FBI is conducting an investigation into the Seattle police department to see if there have been any civil rights violations being practiced in the department.  Yes, you heard right \u2013 the same folks who assassinated Fred Hampton and had this to say after the fact:\r\n\r\n    \u201cWe expected about twenty Panthers to be in the apartment when the police raided the place. Only two of those black n**** f****** were killed, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.\u201d  \u2014FBI Special Agent Gregg York  Source\r\n\r\nThe same agency that will knock on your door if you signed the wrong petition or hold \u201cextreme\u201d views?  Is it the same agency that\u2019s been going around the country illegally entrapping credulous Muslim youths for propaganda props?  The same ones who want backdoors installed on popular social-networking sites to keep an eye on you, in clear violation of the 4th Amendment?  A sure waste of taxpayer dollars!\r\n\r\nIrrespective of government actions, it was incredibly inspiring to see the brave souls take to the streets in Seattle.  It\u2019s now more important than ever to have the cameras at the ready on the public servants we call the police \u2014 the same \u201cservants\u201d who seem to have no accountability.  The cop who killed Oscar Grant, Johannes Mehserle, received a total of 292 days in prison; less than Michael Vick got for fighting dogs.  A tacit admission that a dog\u2019s life has more value in America\u2019s \u201cjustice system.\u201d  While prosecutor Dan Satterberg stated that he was unable to press charges on cop Ian Birk who brutality murdered John T. Williams, because \u201cunder the 1986 statute, he can\u2019t file charges when a police officer makes an arguably \u2018good faith\u2019 mistake, he insisted.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith that argument, if a civilian kills a cop in \u201cgood faith\u201d will prosecutors abstain in making murder charges stick?  Hardly! This kind of thing has been happening to minorities for years and their complaints were incessantly ignored.  This is what happens when you ignore the plight of ethnic and religious minorities.  Sooner or later, the boot on their necks will end up on yours.\r\n\r\nKnow your rights!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stopfbi.net/sites/default/files/CCR_If_An_Agent_Knocks-1.pdf\r\nhttp://www.copblock.org\r\nhttp://www.copwatch.org \r\n\r\nRick Gedeon is graduate from USAF Air University, amateur historian, and anti-imperial/anti-police brutality activist.
