Barack Obama\u2019s Organizing for America website is helping to organize the \u201cday of rage\u201d protests in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nWhat a complete shock.\r\n\r\nBen Smith at The Politico reported:\r\n\r\nThe Democratic National Committee\u2019s Organizing for America arm \u2013 the remnant of the 2008 Obama campaign \u2014 is playing an active role in organizing protests against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\u2019s attempt to strip most public employees of collective bargaining rights. \r\n\r\nOfA, as the campaign group is known, has been criticized at times for staying out of local issues like same-sex marraige, but it\u2019s riding to the aide of the public sector unions who hoping to persuade some Republican legislators to oppose Walker\u2019s plan. And while Obama may have his difference with teachers unions, OfA\u2019s engagement with the fight \u2014 and Obama\u2019s own clear stance against Walker \u2014 mean that he\u2019s remaining loyal to key Democratic Party allies at what is, for them, a very dangerous moment.\r\n\r\nThe OFA Wisconsin twitter feed bragged about how they used students as props at their protests today.\r\n\r\nhttp://gatewaypundit.rightnetwork.com/2011/02/shocker-obama-administration-is-behind-the-day-of-rage-in-wisconsin-students-used-as-props", "group_id": 3920, "id": 148866}]
