Discussion group for anti-NWO / Ilumminai, Martial Law Alerts by region. The use of HAARP to manipilate weather and cause Earthquakes. The collapse of the American Dollar / Gold and Silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site is hosted by Grouply, which looks like a Facebook-style news feed without all the bells & whistles? (It's definitely more functional than Convore & I'm considering starting a SCMLA group there.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those of you looking for more discussion/interaction & are anti-Facebook (& who isn't?), it looks like it might be a good place to hang out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKim M.\r\n\r\nOrganizer\r\n\r\nSoCal Martial Law Alerts\r\n\r\nhttp://www.meetup.com/socalmartiallawalerts/messages/boards/thread/10753750", "group_id": 3920, "id": 819862}]
