Are American citizens now being searched before they can leave train stations? Why are children being targeted as possible terrorists when they get off of trains?\r\n\r\n    As Reported By Witness:\r\n\r\n    The only bad thing on our trip was [the] TSA at the Savannah train station. There were about 14 agents pulling people inside the building and coralling everyone in a roped area after you got off the train. This made no sense! Poor family in front of us! 9-year old getting patted down and wanded. They groped our people too and were very unprofessional. I am all about security, but when have you ever been harassed and felt up getting off a plane? Shouldn\u2019t they be doing that getting on? And they wonder why so many people are mad at them.\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely illegal and disgusting. The rolling out of the police state is FULL THROTTLE.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR0G7t609Zc\r\n\r\nhttp://theintelhub.com/2011/02/24/tsa-harasses-9-year-old-boy-after-train-ride", "group_id": 3920, "id": 206535}]
