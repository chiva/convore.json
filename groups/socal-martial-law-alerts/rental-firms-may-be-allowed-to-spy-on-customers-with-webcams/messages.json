The incident led to one outraged couple filing suit against the company, seeking class action status.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for that couple... their case was dealt a serious setback by Judge Sean Mclaughlin...\r\n\r\nIn his ruling, the judge refused to grant a preliminary injunction, which would have banned Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees from both continuing to monitor users... and from conducting activities to obfuscate which computers had the spykit installed...\r\n\r\nThe court rules that that the plaintiffs don't have the computer any more and thus are no longer suffering harm and that they provided insufficient evidence to demonstrate that other members of the potential class are currently suffering harm.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailytech.com/Rental+Firms+May+be+Allowed+to+Spy+on+Customers+With+Webcams/article22204.htm", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1696597}]
