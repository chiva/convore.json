If you\u2019re an AT&T or T-Mobile customer, though, TruePosition may have heard of you. When you\u2019re in danger, the company can tell the cops where you are, all without you knowing. And now, it\u2019s starting to let governments around the world in on the search.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania company, a holding of the Liberty Media giant that owns Sirius XM and the Atlanta Braves, provides location technology to those soon-to-be-merged carriers, so police, firefighters and medics can know where you\u2019re at in an emergency. In the U.S., it locates over 60 million 911 calls annually. But very quietly, over the last four years, TruePosition has moved into the homeland security business \u2014 worldwide.\r\n\r\nAround the world, TruePosition markets something it calls \u201clocation intelligence,\u201d or LOCINT, to intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As a homeland security tool, it\u2019s enticing. Imagine an \u201cinvisible barrier around sensitive sites like critical infrastructure,\u201d such as oil refineries or power plants, TruePosition\u2019s director of marketing, Brian Varano, tells Danger Room. The barrier contains a list of known phones belonging to people who work there, allowing them to pass freely through the covered radius. \u201cIf any phone enters that is not on the authorized list, [authorities] are immediately notified.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/07/global-phone-tracking", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1707325}]
