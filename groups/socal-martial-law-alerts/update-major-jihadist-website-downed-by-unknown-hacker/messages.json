The fact that they've been allowed to continue operating for so long implies that US agencies found it more useful that way.\r\n\r\nOne obvious suspect is the Jester, a self-styled 'hacktivist for good' who was allegedly behind the hacks of Wikileaks, 4Chan and a number of other Jihadist websites. However, while he reported on his Twitter feed that Al-Shamukh was down, he hasn't claimed responsibility.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tgdaily.com/security-features/56954-major-jihadist-website-downed-by-unknown-hacker?quicktabs_1=0", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1535387}]
