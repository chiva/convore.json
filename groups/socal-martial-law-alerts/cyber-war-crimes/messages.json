The regime went on to warn \u201cWestern Nations\u201d if they had a hand in such terror effort. As you may recall from our earlier blog post, Majid Shahriari, one of Iran\u2019s leading nuclear scientists who also was the leader for Iran\u2019s investigation into the Stuxnet cyber attack on their nuclear enrichment program, was assassinated on November 29, 2010 while in his car and on his way to work in Tehran.\r\n\r\nIntelligence analysis suggests that this action is the direct result of the arrest and subsequent investigation of what Iranian officials call a ten person spy ring that was said to be operating within Iran and involved in Stuxnet cyber espionage. Iran\u2019s Intelligence Minister has been quoted as saying, \u201cThe network of spies and terrorists linked to Mossad was destroyed.\u201d He went on to say the alleged spies \u201chave confessed to being trained by the Mossad and receiving all of their equipment from that agency.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say how deep this litigation will get into the details of the Stuxnet code and attack; but given Majid Shahriari was so involved with the Stuxnet investigation it is bound to be introduced into any court action that might occur. If court action does take place some interesting issues might arise due to all the attention Stuxnet has received.  For instance could this mean that Jeff Carr who received headlines like \u2014 \u2018Jeff Carr: China Most Likely Candidate for Stuxnet\u2019s Origin\u2019 found on The New New Internet web site be called to testify for the defense?\r\n\r\nIranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast disclosed few details about Iran\u2019s litigation strategy and no mention has been made as to what international court will be called upon to address this challenging legal issue. We should all keep in mind that there is very little case law when it comes to acts of cyber aggression, let alone case law addressing murder and cyber espionage.  One thing is certain \u2013 this will be worth watching as it could set a legal precedent for future actions!\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2011/01/18/cyber-war-crimes", "group_id": 3920, "id": 116624}]
