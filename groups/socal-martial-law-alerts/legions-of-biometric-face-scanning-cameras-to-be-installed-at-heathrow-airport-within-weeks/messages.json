Three years ago we reported that passport control officers at UK airports were to be phased out in favour of the biometric cameras.\r\n\r\nIt was then revealed two months later that Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, wishes to integrate a facial database with its already existing fingerprint and DNA databases.\r\n\r\nThe organization, is planning to expand its role into the mass screening of passengers moving around the world by creating a face recognition database to catch wanted suspects, reported the London Guardian at the time.\r\n\r\nSuch a database will hold the records of every citizen who has ever traveled in and out of virtually every country in the world, representing intelligence agency style bulk interception of information.\r\n\r\nWe have previously noted that the vast array of databases currently being employed by intelligence agencies, government and law enforcement agencies worldwide were designed to be linked together in a system which will tie in the management and control of all facets of life for citizens to one central hub.\r\n\r\n2008 saw the announcement of a vast intelligence program to establish a global biometric database known as \u201cServer in the Sky\u201d that will collate and provide an \u201d International Information Consortium\u201d with access to the biometric measurements and personal information of citizens across the globe in the name of fighting the \u201cwar on terror\u201d.\r\n\r\nAs reported by the London Guardian, the long term plan is being formulated by the FBI with the cooperation of the home offices and law enforcement agencies of American allies. The technology is being supplied by the US defense company Northrop Grumman.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the use of such technology, as we have already seen, will not be limited to the passport control office.\r\n\r\nA 2007 British government report muted an extensive upgrade to cctv systems all across the country to incorporate facial scanning technology. The report suggested a central database of every camera and a network allowing access to it could be beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn the US there are several schemes that use Facial Recognition Technology in conjunction with Federal agencies, tying the technology to traditional documents such as drivers licenses, passports and credit cards.\r\n\r\nA biometric face recognition system has already been approved in China and is expected to be used at airports, customs entrances, banks, post offices, residential areas and other public places in the near future.\r\n\r\nOther proposals include placing the cameras in every seat on aircraft and installing software to try and automatically detect terrorists or other dangers caused by passengers.\r\n\r\nWe are assured that cigarette vending machines will employ the technology in order to enforce smoking laws. Similarly, supermarkets in the UK have already started trialing the technology with the justification being a crackdown on underage drinking.\r\n\r\nIn Japan facial scanning cameras are being installed in train and bus stations to replace tickets in a move to make the individual features of the face a \u201cunique bar code\u201d as part of an antiterrorism and anticrime initiative.\r\n\r\nPolice in Tokyo are also asking home and shop owners to mount the cameras outside their properties. \u201cPolice investigating an incident in the neighborhood would have access to these images.\u201d according to reports.\r\n\r\nCell phones and computers are now also being produced with face scanning cameras, and even facebook has now integrated facial recognition software.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of the technology being so widely used was recently even critisized by Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. A prominent Bilderberger and a man who once said that internet users should have no expectation of privacy, Schmidt said  \u201cShow us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are,\u201d before warning governments of adopting any \u201cfoolish\u201d legislation that would see facial recognition technology become a part of everyday life.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/legions-of-biometric-face-scanning-cameras-to-be-installed-at-heathrow-airport-within-weeks", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1691705}]
