She never paused speaking. When Secretary Clinton began her speech, Mr. McGovern remained standing silently in the audience and turned his back. Mr. McGovern, a veteran Army officer who also worked as a CIA analyst for 27 years, was wearing a Veterans for Peace t-shirt.\r\n\r\nBlind-sided by security officers who pounced upon him, Mr. McGovern remarked, as he was hauled out the door, \u201cSo this is America?\u201d Mr. McGovern is covered with bruises, lacerations and contusions inflicted in the assault.\r\n\r\nMr. McGovern is being represented by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund (PCJF). \u201cIt is the ultimate definition of lip service that Secretary of State Clinton would be trumpeting the U.S. government\u2019s supposed concerns for free speech rights and this man would be simultaneously brutalized and arrested for engaging in a peaceful act of dissent at her speech,\u201d stated attorney Mara Verheyden-Hilliard of the PCJF.\r\n\r\nMr. McGovern now works for Tell the Word, a publishing arm of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nhttp://911truthnews.com/ray-mcgovern-bloodied-and-arrested-at-clinton-speech", "group_id": 3920, "id": 130014}]
