The invocation of all things \u201cgreen,\u201d it seems, provides justification for just about anything these days\u2026 including war.\r\n\r\nThis new \u201cgreen\u201d UN initiative is due for discussion in a special meeting of the United Nations security council, where the organization will decide whether to expand its \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d role to cover everything that happens in a world suffering under climate change. An article in The Guardian explains that this plan involves \u201c\u2026a new environmental peacekeeping force \u2014 green helmets \u2014 which could step into conflicts caused by shrinking resources.\u201d (http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jul/20/un-climate-change-peacekeeping)\r\n\r\nJustification for UN troops on U.S. soil?\r\n\r\nThis would give the UN justification to place a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d force on U.S. soil, of course. Virtually the entire U.S. Southeast \u2014 from Texas all the way to D.C. \u2014 is currently sweltering under a severe heat wave combined with a hundred-year drought in many areas. Under the UN\u2019s new \u201cclimate change peacekeeping\u201d initiatives, if crop failures result in riots, they could drop in a few hundred thousand UN troops \u2014 all wearing GREEN helmets \u2014 and then explain they\u2019re here to save us from \u201cconflicts caused by shrinking resources.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause, you know, GREEN means it\u2019s good for us, you see. Perhaps they\u2019ll even paint the tips of their bullets green so that when they start firing into the crowds of innocent protestors, they can claim it\u2019s not an act of war but rather \u201cgreen kinetic action.\u201d The streets may be red with blood, but the evening news will present it all to you as a new \u201cgreen initiative\u201d that\u2019s good for the environment!\r\n\r\nThe Guardian goes on to report:\r\n\r\nIn an official \u201cConcept Note\u201d ahead of the meeting, Germany said the security council needed to draw up scenarios for dealing with the affects of extreme temperatures and rising seas. How would the UN deal with climate refugees?\r\n\r\nAs you can see from this quote, the UN feels that it must function as the police force of the world, intervening in the affairs of sovereign nations, and even painting their helmets green to make it all acceptable to the masses. If a foreign military force invades the United States of America and puts non-U.S. boots on the ground, that\u2019s called a military invasion. But I guess if they paint their helmets green, it\u2019s all okay, right?\r\n\r\nHopefully they\u2019ll paint their helmets NEON green so they stand out much like the British Empire\u2019s redcoat soldiers in 1776 who made easy targets.\r\n\r\nComing soon: Food supply disruptions leading to global riots\r\n\r\nOne thing the UN is getting right in all this, by the way, is the implied prediction that massive global crop failures are headed our way. Given the current depletion of food production resources (topsoil, fossil water supplies, etc.) a global food crisis is now inevitable. Food prices are already skyrocketing around the world, and the widespread use of GMOs is setting up our civilization for devastating food failures due to DNA contamination of food crops.\r\n\r\nFood disruptions will, of course, lead to food riots. And food riots could get pretty ugly in high population areas (cities, namely) where the people import nearly 100 percent of their food. Even in places like New York City, we could see extreme food riots that have never been witnessed before in the history of America. But does this give the UN the right to intervene under the guise of green helmets?\r\n\r\nGlobalists think it does. The global elite are not merely setting us up for UN occupation under the excuse of \u201cclimate change peacekeeping,\u201d they\u2019re also the ones causing many of the problems in the first place! Who\u2019s behind the global GMO invasion? It\u2019s the global elite, of course. That\u2019s why the U.S. state department was caught on record saying that Spain should be punished for resisting GMOs (http://www.naturalnews.com/030828_GMOs_Wikileaks.html)\r\n\r\nHow about global vaccination campaigns that are actuallysterilizationefforts designed to limit population growth? (http://www.naturalnews.com/029911_vaccines_Bill_Gates.html)\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the issue of chemtrails, fluoride and all the other chemicals being dumped into the environment, which actually cause environmental problems that then provide justification for the UN to show up and police the world. Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to just stop poisoning the planet with all these synthetic chemicals in the first place?\r\n\r\nBut no, the more problems there are in our world, the more power security forces are able to exercise over the populations. Conflict enables control. War is power, not peace. Every crisis in an opportunity. \u201cNever waste a good crisis,\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton famously said in a talk about climate change. And that\u2019s the whole point, you see: The global elite wish to exploit the very same environmental crises they\u2019ve caused in order to gain more power over entire nations.\r\n\r\nAnd now with this UN initiative, we\u2019re seeing yet another example of how \u201cgreen\u201d is used as a cover story for military imperialism. The term \u201cclimate change peacekeeping\u201d is downright Orwellian in its tone and intention. Hitler fought wars to create \u201claw and order.\u201d Stalin\u2019s atrocities were done in the name of \u201cpeace.\u201d The Crusades were mass killing campaigns conducted in the name of \u201cGod.\u201d Tyrants always have a justification for their wars, it seems. The killing that used to be done in the name of God will soon be conducted in the name of GREEN.\r\n\r\nSo get ready, America. Your neighborhoods are about to be \u201cpeacekept\u201d by UN forces wearing green helmets and claiming to be operating under environmental initiatives that somehow give them the right to occupy your land and order you to obey. Remember, it\u2019s all about \u201cNever waste a good crisis,\u201d and a global food crisis is headed your way very, very soon.\r\n\r\nNaturalNews readers may be interested in protecting themselves from the coming food crisis by taking advantage of our Food Security course that teaches food preparedness, how to build your own water filter, how to create a food \u201cgo bag\u201d and much more.
