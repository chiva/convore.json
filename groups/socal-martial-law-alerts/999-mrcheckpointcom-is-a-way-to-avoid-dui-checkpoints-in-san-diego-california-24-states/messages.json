It's priced at $9.99 per month, with a $5 discount to users who sign a pledge not to drink and drive.\r\n\r\nSober drivers have excellent reason to want to avoid San Diego DUI checkpoints, lawyers point out. A large majority of cars impounded at San Diego County DUI checkpoints are for offenses unrelated to drunk driving. Municipalities, the station reported, benefit financially from impounding cars through contracts with towing companies, attorneys learned.\r\n\r\nReviewing Devermont's video, David Blair-Loy, legal director for the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial Counties, maintains the police search of his wallet was probably illegal, because he previously provided his ID.\r\n\r\nACLU believes DUI checkpoints are violations of civil rights, although courts have upheld them as constitutional as long as they follow certain requirements in California.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mrcheckpoint.com", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1634887}]
