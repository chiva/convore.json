The program was developed through the aegis of the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), which inherited many of the invasive Internet surveillance programs from its Pentagon cousin, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA), after its programs, including the proposed Total Information Awareness program, were defunded by Congress\r\n\r\nThe Avatar Identity Program appears to coincide with another Air Force project to solicit \u201cpersona management software\u201d to create virtual users on the Internet in order to conduct perception management campaigns to inundate chat rooms, letter to the editor, and on-line polls to sway public opinion on key issues.\r\n\r\nIt was also recently revealed that the computer security firm HB Gary Federal worked in a program to create and manage \u201csock puppet\u201d Internet users to infiltrate websites to create confusion and propagate disinformation. The program was to be used to attack WikiLeaks and apparently was linked to the US Chamber of Commerce, the Bank of America, the bank\u2019s chief law firm Hunton & Williams, and two other technology firms that later withdrew from participation: Palantir Technologies and Berico Technologies. More ominous is the report that it was the Department of Justice recommended the use of HB Gary Federal, Palantir, and Berico (known as Team Themis, which would operate a Corporate Information Reconnaissance Cell [CIRC]) to the Chamber, the Bank of America, and Hunton & Williams to engage in the sock puppet management operation. The program matches recommendations from White House Office of Information Regulatory Affairs chief Dr. Cass Sunstein, who has referred to such operations as \u201ccognitive infiltration.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, Homeland Security\u2019s Avatar Identity program involves the creation of an avatar for every Internet user that pulls information from the actual user\u2019s Google searches, Twitter messages, Facebook postings, on-line commerce activities, and other web interactions and feeds the transactions to the avatar program. Intelligence analysts then query the avatar for details of the user\u2019s activities.\r\n\r\nWMR was informed that the Avatar Identity Program was first developed for every known terrorist in the world. However, it has now expanded to include every Internet user and it is being aggressively used to identify and track down members of the hacktivist group \u201cAnonymous,\u201d which has attacked the computer systems of HB Gary Federal, Bank of America, and other firms seen as waging a war against Internet freedom.\r\n\r\nAs an example of its practical use, the Avatar Identity Program records all on-line letters to President Obama sent via the White House web site, as well as any searches for Obama on the Internet.\r\n\r\nOur source explained the avatar program by saying, \u201cEvery Internet user has a life on the Internet,\u201d adding, \u201cbut with the avatar, every user has a second life on the web.\u201d In the case of the avatar, every Internet user has a virtual \u201csnitch\u201d that reports their every action and movement on the web to the government.\r\n\r\n=======\r\nThe solicitation for the Air Force\u2019s Persona Management program:\r\n\r\nSolicitation Number:\r\n\r\nRTB220610\r\n\r\nNotice Type:\r\n\r\nSources Sought\r\n\r\nSynopsis:\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\nJun 22, 2010 1:42 pmModified:\r\nJun 22, 2010 2:07 pmTrack Changes\r\n\r\n0001- Online Persona Management Service. 50 User Licenses, 10 Personas per user.\r\n\r\nSoftware will allow 10 personas per user, replete with background , history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographacilly consistent. Individual applications will enable an operator to exercise a number of different online persons from the same workstation and without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries. Personas must be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact through conventional online services and social media platforms. The service includes a user friendly application environment to maximize the user\u2019s situational awareness by displaying real-time local information.\r\n\r\n0002- Secure Virtual Private Network (VPN). 1 each\r\n\r\nVPN provides the ability for users to daily and automatically obtain randomly selected IP addresses through which they can access the internet. The daily rotation of the user s IP address prevents compromise during observation of likely or targeted web sites or services, while hiding the existence of the operation. In addition, may provide traffic mixing, blending the user s traffic with traffic from multitudes of users from outside the organization. This traffic blending provides excellent cover and powerful deniability.
