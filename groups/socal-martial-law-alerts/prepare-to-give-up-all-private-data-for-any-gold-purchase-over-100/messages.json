It is much worse. A bill proposed in the State of Washington (House Bill 1716), by representatives Asay, Hurst, Klippert, Pearson, and Miloscia, whose alleged purpose is to regulate secondhand gold dealers, seeks to capture \"the name, date of birth, sex, height, weight, race, and address and telephone number of the person with whom the transaction is made\" or said otherwise, of every purchaser of gold in the state of Washington. Furthermore, if passed, Bill 1716 will record \"a complete description of the property pledged, bought, or consigned, including the brand name, serial number, model number or name, any initials or engraving, size, pattern, and color or stone or stones\" and of course price. But the kicker: if a transaction is mode for an amount over $100, which means one tenth of an ounce of golds, also required will be a \"signature, photo, and fingerprint of the person with whom the transaction is made.\" In other words, very soon Washington state will know more about you than you know about yourself, if you dare to buy any gold object worth more than a C-note. How this proposal is supposed to protect consumers against vulture gold dealers we don't quite get. Hopefully someone will explain it to us. We do, however, get how Americans will part with any and all privacy if they were to exchange fiat for physical. And in a police state like America, this will likely not be taken lightly, thereby killing the gold trade should the proposed Bill pass, and be adopted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile we are confident that representatives Asay, Hurst, Klippert, Pearson, and Miloscia have no clue why they are even proposing this bill, we would also be delighted to find out which moneyed interests they represent, and what happens to precious metal trading in America should Bill 1716 become a legal precedent which is effectively the first step before the final implementation of Executive Order 6102 version 2.\r\n\r\nFull bill (pdf)\r\n\r\nhttp://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2011-12/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1716.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/article/prepare-give-all-private-data-any-gold-purchase-over-100", "group_id": 3920, "id": 155166}]
