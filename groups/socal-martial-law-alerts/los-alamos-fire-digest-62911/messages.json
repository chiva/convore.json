Fire, Nuclear Lab Fear Radioactive Smoke Plume\nFoxNews\nJune 29, 2011\n\nTowns Near N.M. Fire, Nuclear Lab Fear Radioactive Smoke Plume 29 Jun 2011 Residents downwind of a wildfire that is threatening the nation's premier nuclear-weapons laboratory are worried about the potential of a radioactive smoke plume if the flames reach thousands of barrels of waste stored in above-ground tents. Lab Director Charles McMillan said the barrels contain transuranic waste -- gloves, toolboxes, tools -- and other items that may have been contaminated through contact with radioactive materials. Top lab officials declined to say how many barrels were on site or how they are stored. An anti-nuclear group has estimated there could be up to 30,000 gallon-drums.\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/06/29/wildfire-advances-toward-nm-nuke-lab-raising-contamination-concerns\n\nLos Alamos scurries to protect nuclear lab from fire\nReuters\nJune 29, 2011\n\nLos Alamos scurries to protect nuclear lab from fire --Nuclear weapons lab closes due to fire danger -- Fire has potential to double or triple in size 28 Jun 2011 New Mexico fire managers scrambled on Tuesday to reinforce crews battling a third day against an out-of-control blaze at the edge of one of the nation's top nuclear weapons production centers. The fire's leading edge burned to within a few miles (kilometres) of a dump site where some 20,000 barrels of plutonium-contaminated waste is stored at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, fire officials said.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/28/usa-wildfires-nuclear-idUSN1E75R1KH20110628\n\nLos Alamos nuclear lab: New Mexico fire forces closure\nBBC\n28 June 2011\n\nDoug Tucker, Los Alamos fire chief: \"We're doing our best to keep it off the lab.\" One of the top nuclear weapons research facilities in the US will remain closed until Thursday as fire fighters battle a wildfire raging at its boundary. Only \"essential-duties\" staff at Los Alamos National Laboratory will be permitted on site on Wednesday. Officials at the New Mexico facility have said they detected \"no off-site releases of contamination\". The town outside the laboratory in the state of New Mexico was evacuated on Monday as the fire raged nearby. Officials said the nuclear facilities faced \"no immediate threat\" but warned of damage to houses. The lab, opened during World War II, led the development of the atomic bomb.

The number one priority at the moment is to make sure all the radioactive and hazardous material is protected, Janet Bettinger, deputy manager of finance, told NBC News. She said she couldn't confirm that it is protected at this point. The fire has burned around 44,000 acres and was threatening buildings, power lines and natural gas lines, Bettinger said.\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43544283/ns/weather", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1516861}]
