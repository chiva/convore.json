You're looking for the nuclear device?\u2019 asked Mr Blacher.\r\n\r\n\u2018Correct. Weapons of mass effect,\u2019 said Mr Hallor.\r\n\r\n\u2018You ever found one?\u2019 asked Mr Blacher.\r\n\r\n\u2018Not at this location,\u2019 Mr Hallor said.\r\n\r\n\u2018But they have found them?\u2019 asked Mr Blacher.\r\n\r\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Mr Hallor.\r\n\r\n\u2018You never found one in San Diego though?\u2019 Mr Blacher asked.\r\n\r\n\u2018I would say at the port of San Diego we have not,\u2019 Mr Hallor said.\r\n\r\n\u2018Have you found one in San Diego?\u2019 Mr Blacher asked.\r\n\r\nThe interview was then interrupted and cut short by a public relations official before Mr Hallor was able to answer the question.\r\n\r\nSan Diego's Customs and Border Protection agency was unavailable for comment today.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Mr Hallor told Mr Blacher: \u2018Potentially every city in America is a target. Given the waterways and the access to the Navy fleet here, I\u2019d say, absolutely, San Diego is a target.\r\n\r\n\u2018Our overall arching mission is to protect the American homeland against terrorists and from weapons of mass effect from entering the country. We are the guardians of America\u2019s borders.\u2019\r\n\r\nHe was explaining how the port checks cargo ships arriving at the port. He suggested the customs \u2018partner agencies\u2019 may have found the 'weapons of mass effect.'\r\n\r\nFormer Secret Service agent and airline security director Glen Winn told 10News Mr Hallor\u2019s comments appeared to be credible.\r\n\r\n\u2018This person was, I believe, knowledgeable, has a very important position with the port and the government and as such has that knowledge,\u2019 he said.\r\n\r\n\u2018You posed some very serious questions as to security gaps and discoveries that perhaps have taken place in this area.\r\n\r\n'I want to know how many and where did you find them so if I'm in that area, driving around and I see something that is out of place, I make a phone call,\u2019 he added.\r\n\r\nBut 10News said a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security told them Mr Hallor was 'just nervous' in the interview and 'mis-spoke'.\r\n\r\nThe spokesman denied officials said weapons of mass destruction had never been found in the U.S.- but would not answer questions about dirty bombs or chemical weapons.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, the Customs and Border Protection department in San Diego issued a statement denying it had dealt with any nuclear-related smuggling attempts.\r\n\r\n\u2018CBP has not specifically had any incidents with nuclear devices or nuclear materials at our ports of entry,\u2019 it said.\r\n\r\n\u2018CBP is an all-threats agency. The purpose of many security measures is to prevent threats from ever materializing by being prepared for them.\r\n\r\n'And, we must be prepared to stop threats in whatever form they do materialise at the border, whether it\u2019s an individual or cargo arriving by land, air, or sea.\r\n\r\n'Regardless of what the contraband or threat is, we\u2019re being smart, evaluating, and focusing in on anything or anyone that is potentially high-risk.\u2019\r\n\r\nNo WMDs have ever been smuggled into the US, or, a least, none have been disclosed.\r\n\r\nThere were reports more than six years ago that al Qaeda was planning to try and sneak a bomb through a secret tunnel into Arizona from northern Mexico, although it was never substantiated. Just last year, a 2,200 ft cross-border drugs tunnel was discovered in San Diego, complete with lighting and ventilation.\r\n\r\nOne reason for covering up a known attempt would be to prevent public panic. Just three days ago, acting Inspector General of the Department of Justice, Cynthia Schnedar, criticised U.S. efforts to prepare for a potential WMD attack as 'uncoordinated and fragmented'.\r\n\r\nWhile the FBI had made adequate precautions for dealing with a WMD fallout, other branches of the DOJ were not sufficiently ready.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the FBI, other departments had no training, did not participate in drills and had not selected an individual to take charge over WMD response operations, she said.\r\n\r\n'In addition, while the department had designated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as the lead agency to coordinate the use of federal law enforcement resources to maintain public safety and security if local and state resources are overwhelmed during a WMD incident, ATF had not adequately prepared for this role,' she added.\r\n\r\nA year ago, the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism said the U.S. government should be doing more to prevent the nuclear threat.\r\n\r\nWork to improve the nation's response to biological attacks and efforts to reform intelligence gathering and other aspects of homeland security all received an 'F' on the report.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1356645/A-weapon-mass-destruction-U-S--Shock-confession-Customs-officer.html", "group_id": 3920, "id": 118670}]
