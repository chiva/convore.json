U.S. special ops troops have been in the country for quite some time, helping to train local security forces in fighting al Qaeda.\r\n\r\nYes, drones crash quite frequently in combat zones for a variety of reasons. What\u2019s interesting here is the Yemeni government\u2019s inability to secure the wreckage, even when it can get its hands on it.\r\n\r\n    The drone crashed in Jahayn village near Loder, in Yemen\u2019s Abyan province where al-Qaida has a strong presence, and was found by local residents, the official told AFP.\r\n\r\n    Witnesses said residents called in police, who collected the debris.\r\n\r\n    But as they headed to a police station about 18 miles away, al-Qaida gunmen in cars intercepted the police and hijacked the wreckage.\r\n\r\n    There were no reports of casualties.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is just a one time event, the type that often happens in combat zones or maybe this is a small sign of how tenuous a hold on power the embattled Yemeni government has in a country with a rather long history of insurgency. We\u2019ll see what happens there in the coming months and years.\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2011/02/08/u-s-drone-crashes-in-yemen-al-qaeda-steals-wreckage-from-police", "group_id": 3920, "id": 118102}, {"user_id": 11626, "stars": [], "topic_id": 6299, "date_created": 1297840744.7535081, "message": "Al-CIA-da stole the wreckage from the police.
