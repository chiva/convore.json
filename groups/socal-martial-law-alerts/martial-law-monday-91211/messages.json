The message provides further evidence that Facebook is not only monitoring discussions, but also feels compelled to warn users about the supposed inappropriateness of their political viewpoints, especially if they deviate from prepackaged left-vs-right political viewpoints propagated by the establishment. The misspelling contained in the comment indicates it is probably not a boiler-plated message but was written specifically in response to the discussion. The Facebook is message received by McBreen is intimidation, pure and simple.

These Bastrop residents don\u2019t need the cops to protect their property. \u201cBefore Bastrop residents can re-enter, they must register and receive credentials to authorize their entrance to the residential area,\u201d the ABC affiliate reported today. Residents \u201cwill need a photo ID to verify residency.\u201d The article does not report what will happen to residents who do not produce ID or who enter the area without gaining permission from the state. The wildfires that raced through Texas destroyed 1,554 homes, officials said Sunday. The figure is expected to increase. On Saturday, residents confronted authorities after they were not allowed to re-enter their homes to assess damage and claim belongings. Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald told the media officials are trying to get residents back into their homes as soon as possible, but he didn\u2019t know how long that would take. The registration program was announced late Sunday. On Friday, Obama issued a major disaster declaration for Texas. \u201cFederal assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured or underinsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,\u201d YNN in Austin reported on Saturday. Residents were asked to register last week so authorities could estimate a \u201cheadcount.\u201d Now they must register to return to their private property. On Tuesday, September 6, Infowars.com reported that federal officials arrived at the scene in Bastrop and Smithville and assumed command of the operation. Alex Jones was contacted on by firefighters who confirmed that FEMA blocked volunteer assistance and frustrated local attempts through the U.S. Forest Service and its maze of bureaucratic red tape. The firefighters and other volunteers report that the Forest Service did not respond to their efforts to clear federal hurdles put in the way of a response to the worst fire in Texas history.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/residents-of-texas-fire-area-must-register-with-police\r\n\r\n[WE'LL START SEEING THIS IN AMERICA UNDER MARTIAL LAW]\r\nAl-Jazeera Egypt shut down for \u2018sowing dissent\u2019\r\nAFP\r\nMonday, September 12, 2011\r\n\r\nCAIRO \u2014 The satellite channel Al-Jazeera Egypt said on Sunday the authorities had prevented it from broadcasting, after entering its offices and confiscating transmission equipment. Ahmed Zain, the channel\u2019s chief in Cairo, told AFP that police, officers from the culture ministry and representatives of Egypt\u2019s public broadcaster had also seized materials and that one technician was arrested. He said they cited the lack of an official licence to broadcast and a complaint from the neighbourhood. He said a lawyer also presented a complaint accusing the channel of \u201csowing dissent\u201d and \u201ccalling for demonstrations.\u201d Zain said Al-Jazeera Egypt had on March 20 requested official authorisation, and that it had been assured it could continue broadcasting in the interim.\r\nhttp://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/09/11/al-jazeera-egypt-shut-down-for-sowing-dissent\r\n\r\nNever going back: Air travel changed for worse, forever after 9/11\r\nNatural News\r\nSeptember 11, 2011\r\n\r\nAs the ten-year anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks quickly approaches, a recent USA Today piece reflects on the drastic, and likely permanent, changes that have taken place in US airport security. What was once a relatively simple and painless walk through the metal detector has mutated into a nightmarish circus of screaming TSA agents, invasive pat-downs, naked body scans, strip searches, and other unconstitutional violations of personal and civil liberties \u2014 and conditions will most likely never return to what they once were before 9/11. Many NaturalNews readers will remember pre-9/11 flying conditions when friends and relatives could freely walk to departure gates to see off their loved ones. Or when spending a few minutes in a short security line, with no convoluted restrictions on liquids or wearing shoes, was all it took to board a flight. These were the days when Americans were treated more like innocent travelers than guilty terrorists, and when airport security was not run by the heavy hand of a bloated federal government. But everything changed, of course, after the 9/11 tragedy took place. Americans willingly sacrificed their freedom in the name of security and protection against terrorists. And as well-intentioned as many people likely were in bowing down to the federal overlords that were all-too-quick to unlawfully search them and seize their property, this capitulation to tyranny has made air travel feel more like lining up for roll call at a Nazi concentration camp than simply embarking on a peaceful and more rapid form of transportation than bus or car.\r\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/033543_air_travel_9-11.html\r\n\r\nIn the Wake of 9/11: 33 of 50 States Are Actively Spying on Americans\r\nActivist Post\r\nSeptember 11, 2011\r\n\r\nThe weekend of the 10th Anniversary of 9/11, has caused many to reflect on the event itself, as well as the decade that we have experienced since. There have indeed been many casualties to recall. One of the saddest casualties is the First Amendment to the nation\u2019s founding document; it is effectively dead in 33 states according to a ACLU compilation of incident reports across America. A targeted program of surveillance and harassment has become fully centered on the population itself. This was first made evident in the 2009 MIAC report, which cited supporters of prominent political candidates like Ron Paul, as well as an assortment of other activists who support peace, freedom and liberty, as potential threats. Law enforcement has been directed to treat such \u201cdangers\u201d with suspicion and extreme caution. The ACLU has compiled an interactive map of those states which have logged incidents of police harassment and surveillance of Americans engaging in other apparently un-American activities, namely: peaceful protest, photographing public servants while on duty, questioning American leadership and policy, recording one\u2019s surroundings while in public, and having certain religious or political affiliations that could apparently be tied to extremism. Here are just a few examples among dozens of incident reports cited by the ACLU that show the range of First Amendment violations.\r\n\ufeffhttp://www.activistpost.com/2011/09/in-wake-of-911-33-of-50-states-are.html\ufeff\r\n\r\nNYPD\u2019s 1000 \u201cAnti-Terror Cops\u201d Have Tanks, Weapons, Navy\r\nCBS News\r\nSeptember 10, 2011\r\n\r\nKelly has his own army \u2014 1,000 anti-terror cops with tanks and weapons, carved out of the NYPD after 9/11.\r\nhttp://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/09/08/exclusive-elaborate-new-york-city-post-911-security\r\n\r\n9/11 Anniversary: Reminding Americans They Now Live In A Police State\r\nInfowars.com\r\nSeptember 9, 2011\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of 9/11 offers an ideal opportunity to remind Americans, especially New Yorkers, that they live in a police state. Bloomberg tells New Yorkers they are terror suspects. From NBC New York on Thursday: \"New Yorkers can expect to see extra subway bag checks, vehicle checkpoints and more police officers throughout the city as U.S. intelligence officials have picked up threat information about possible terror attacks to coincide with the 10th anniversary of 9/11.\" The \u201cthreat information\u201d is of the usual caliber \u2013 uncorroborated and unsubstantiated. \u201cBut we live in a world where we must take these threats seriously, and we will,\u201d promised New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. \u201cWe know the terrorists regard the anniversary as an opportunity to strike again.\u201d He was flanked by Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Janice K. Fedarcyk, the director of the FBI in New York.

The device, manufactured by Terrahawk, LLC, is basically a high-tech prison guard tower fitted with surveillance and communications capabilities. It was demonstrated yesterday to \u201cMembers of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate along with their staffs; with MUST, law enforcement agencies can quickly set up a mobile surveillance tower for emergency response, crowd control, or general surveillance,\u201d reports Homeland Security Newswire. The fact that Congress members and Senators were given a special demonstration of the unit suggests that its makers are pushing for the device to be approved for widespread use by law enforcement domestically, and not just on the border with Mexico. Indeed, the tower is already being used inside the United States on a limited scale. In December, members of the South New Jersey Tyranny Response Team spotted one of the units with blacked-out windows situated next to a city park in a low crime area where it remained for several days.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/lawmakers-pushed-to-approve-high-tech-guard-tower-for-crowd-control\r\n\r\nDo You Now Understand Why You Need To Prepare For Emergencies?\r\nThis Has Been The Worst Year For Natural Disasters In U.S. History\r\nThe Economic Collapse\r\nSeptember 9, 2011\r\n\r\nThere has been a natural disaster that has caused at least a billion dollars of damage inside the United States every single month so far this year.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there have been10 major disasters in the United States this year.  On average, usually there are only about 3 major disasters a year.  At this point, disasters are happening inside the United States so frequently that there seems to be no gap between them.  We just seem to go from one major disaster to the next.  Last year, FEMA declared an all-time record of 81 disasters inside the United States.  This year, we are on pace for well over 100.  We just got done dealing with Hurricane Irene, and now we are dealing with historic wildfires in Texas and unprecedented flooding up in the northeast part of the country.  This has been the worst year for natural disasters in U.S. history, and we still have nearly four months left to go.\r\nhttp://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/do-you-now-understand-why-you-need-to-prepare-for-emergencies-this-has-been-the-worst-year-for-natural-disasters-in-u-s-history\r\n\r\nLife in Prison for Recording Police: Michael Allison Speaks (video)\r\nInfowars.com\r\nSeptember 8, 2011\r\n\r\nAlex talks with Michael Allison, a 41-year-old backyard mechanic from southeastern Illinois, who faces up to 75 years in prison for the crime of recording the police.

While Paul vehemently expressed his opposition to welfare and free health care for illegal immigrants, the Texas Congressman cautioned that erecting barbed wire fences and patrolling them with armed troops could eventually be used not to keep illegals out, but to keep Americans in during a period of civil unrest. Saying he didn\u2019t believe \u201cthat\u2019s what America\u2019s all about,\u201d Paul warned that such measures could be used against U.S. citizens. \u201cEvery time you think about this toughness on the border and ID cards and REAL IDs, think it\u2019s a penalty against the American people too. I think this fence business is designed and may well be used against us and keep us in,\u201d said Paul, adding, \u201cIn economic turmoil, the people want to leave with their capital and there\u2019s capital controls and there\u2019s people controls. Every time you think about the fence, think about the fences being used against us, keeping us in.\u201d\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/ron-paul-border-fence-could-be-used-to-keep-us-in\r\n\r\nGibson Guitars proves the environmental police state that wants your wood products and guns\r\nNatural News\r\nSeptember 8, 2011\r\n\r\nThe recent US government raid of Gibson Guitars\u2019 Tennessee manufacturing facility is now receiving widespread media coverage, thanks to a flood of reports that have appeared across the web in recent weeks, including here at NaturalNews. But beyond simply the raid itself is the reality of the new environmental police state that appears to be taking over, where personal wood products of all kinds \u2014 whether they be furniture, hand tools, or even guns made with rare wood stocks \u2014 are now threatened with arbitrary confiscation. As we mentioned previously, the US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s (FWS) use of the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Lacey Act of 2008 to invoke the Gibson raid sets a chilling precedent for the environmental police to go after others, including ordinary individuals, who may possess wood products deemed unacceptable, even if such wood products were obtained legally. You see, Gibson\u2019s import of rosewood and ebony from India was not illegal under either US or Indian law. FWS merely decided to interpret Indian law in its own illogical way, and invoke the Lacey Act as justification for its illegal raid. And if the agency gets away with doing this to Gibson, they will surely do it again to others.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/gibson-guitars-proves-the-environmental-police-state-that-wants-your-wood-products-and-guns\r\n\r\nRon Paul: TSA \u2018abusive,\u2019 involved in \u2018all kind of sexual activities\u2019\r\nPolitico\r\nSeptember 8, 2011\r\n\r\nPut Ron Paul in the anti-pat-down column. The Texas congressman accused the Transportation Security Administration of taking an \u201cabusive\u201d attitude towards passengers, disputing the view that government regulation helps airline security. Paul said of the TSA: \u201cThey\u2019re accused of all kind of sexual activities\u201d To the notion that his libertarian approach to security could threaten passenger safety, Paul said that exactly the reverse was true. It was government policy, he said, that helped make 9/11 possible. \u201cThey told the pilots they couldn\u2019t have guns,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey set up the stage for this.\u201d\r\nhttp://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/62934.html\r\n\r\nUBS: Euro Collapse Could Lead To Martial Law, Civil War\r\nInfowars.com\r\nSeptember 7, 2011\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein to how Hank Paulson threatened martial law on the streets of America if the bailout failed to pass, top banks like UBS are now warning of \u201cauthoritarian or military government\u201d and \u201ccivil war\u201d in a bid to frighten away member states from leaving the euro. It\u2019s a transparent ploy designed to create the pretext for empowering the EU to enforce a common economic policy across all member states, something that British Prime Minister David Cameron is now openly backing. In a UBS Investment Research release, the Swiss bank warns that should member states begin to desert the euro, precipitating a collapse of the single currency, \u201csome form of authoritarian or military government, or civil war,\u201d would likely ensue. The tone of UBS\u2019 advisory sounds very sobering and authoritative, but we\u2019ve seen this type of financial fearmongering before, during the 2008 bailout debate, which was eventually rammed through on the back of bellicose threats about martial law and economic armageddon.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/ubs-euro-collapse-could-lead-to-martial-law-civil-war\r\n\r\nChaos On The Streets Of America\r\nThe American Dream\r\nSeptember 6, 2011\r\n\r\nShould we just expect mass chaos on the streets of America every time a major holiday rolls around?  At least 42 people were hit by gunfire in New York City over the Labor Day weekend.  The violence got so bad that even the mayor felt compelled to publicly address it.  In Chicago, at least 6 people(including a man in a wheelchair) were killed over the Labor Day weekend. Sadly, this is just a continuation of a trend that we have seen build over the past few years.  At the beginning of the summer, there was terrible violence all over America during the Memorial Day weekend.  We also saw violence break out during 4th of July celebrations.  It appears that wherever large groups of young people gather in America today, there is going to be a very good chance that chaos is going to erupt. Almost wherever you look, you can see the frustration of the American people starting to boil over.  Very few public places seem to be immune.\r\nhttp://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/chaos-on-the-streets-of-america\r\n\r\nParents of seven told: Your children are too fat, so you will never see them again\r\nDaily Mail\r\nSeptember 4, 2011\r\n\r\nFour obese children are on the brink of being permanently removed from their family by social workers after their parents failed to bring their weight under control. In the first case of its kind, their mother and father now face what they call the \u2018unbearable\u2019 likelihood of never seeing them again. Their three daughters, aged 11, seven and one, and five-year-old son, will either be \u2018fostered without contact\u2019 or adopted. Either way, the family\u2019s only hope of being reunited will be if the children attempt to track down their parents when they become adults. The couple, who have been married for nearly 20 years and are not being named to protect their children\u2019s identities, were given a \u2018draconian\u2019 ultimatum three years ago \u2013 as reported at the time by The Mail on Sunday.

All for the crime of uploading a YouTube. That is what a 24 year old Virginia man, Jubair Ahmad, faces as the feds charge him with providing support for terrorism for allegedly uploading a propaganda video. The crime comes with the dubious distinction that the accused are treated as if they are actually terrorists or as the U.S. government labels them \u201cenemies combatants\u201d. With the declaration of being an enemy combatant the rights and protections engraved into the Constitution with the full force of our founding father\u2019s very own flesh and blood are instantly nullified. That\u2019s right. The Department of Justice of the great United States of America has charged a Jubair Ahmad, a 24 year old Woodbridge, Virginia man, of providing support for terrorism because he allegedly uploaded a propaganda video to YouTube. The accusation alone instantly classifies the man as an \u2018enemy combatant\u2019  and \u2018clear and present danger\u2019. Such persons who are a \u2018threat to national security\u2019 have absolutely no rights. To make matters worse, businesses and nations aren\u2019t allowed to do business with such so-called \u2018terrorists\u2019 or they will be declared a terrorist themselves. That means a lawyer who takes up his case can be charge with providing support for terrorism. That is  if the United States government  even decides to honor habeas corpus and give the man a trial in the first place. Our beloved supreme court has ruled that \u2018enemy combatants\u2019 can be abducted, tortured,assassinated, and even detained for ever without a trial because the constitution does not apply to them. Even worse, the lucky few who are released after being declared innocent have no right to legal recourse because revealing the details of their detention and torture is also a threat to national security. This is what the \u2018war on terror\u2019 has escalated to, which we have been brainwashed by our government is necessary to protect our liberties from our enemies.\r\nhttp://blog.alexanderhiggins.com/2011/09/02/feds-charge-man-enemy-combatant-supporting-terrorism-uploading-youtube-videos-67721\r\n\r\nThe counterfeit culture \u2013 useful observations for understanding why collapse is inevitable\r\nNatural News\r\nSeptember 2, 2011\r\n\r\nThrough a devolving web of greed, self-serving power and a departure from fundamental ethics, Western culture has, over the last hundred years, become the counterfeit culture.

In an email to the Tribune, attorney Michael Carin said school officials at Carver Primary School on the Far South Side authorized the on-campus security guard in March 2010 to discipline some first-graders who were being disruptive. Giving details not disclosed in the lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, Carin said the school\u2019s security officer removed the students from class and held them in another office on campus where there were no other adults present.

Fox News reported today that the Pentagon is using the overstated hurricane to minimize civilian participation in emergency situations. Troops on the streets: Military convoy in New York in the aftermath of Irene. Over the weekend, the Pentagon appointed \u201cdual-status commanders\u201d to direct both active-duty troops and guardsmen assisting civilian officials in New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina and Rhode Island. In the past, the chain of command was split between federal and state authorities. Under the cover of fixing supposed delays, duplications and gaps after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in August 2005, the Pentagon has further crippled Posse Comitatus \u2013 restricting military involvement in domestic law enforcement \u2013 and limited the participation of the state in disaster and emergency response. This is the first time so-called dual-status commanders have been used for a natural disaster. In the past, they were used at international summits, but not for domestic response to a hurricane. The AP basically reports that the Pentagon used the storm as a beta test for the roll-out of the next phase of the police state \u2013 tight integration of emergency response and law enforcement on the state and local level under the military command and control of the Pentagon and the federal government.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/pentagon-beta-tests-tighter-military-control-of-disaster-response\r\n\r\nMayor Orders Cops To Remove Citizen At Council Meeting For Stating His Name\r\nEpidemic of power abuse amongst local authorities as America sinks deeper into police state\r\nInfowars.com\r\nAugust 26, 2011\r\n\r\nRon Paul supporter and anti-drug war activist Ronnie Reeferseed was hauled away from an Austin City Council meeting and banned for a year for stating his name in a mildly satirical manner, in yet another example of how local officials are increasingly engaging in petty power trips to oppress the free speech rights of American citizens. The video shows Ronnie introducing himself before Mayor Lee Leffingwell snarls, \u201cyou will stop there, step back, your time is up,\u201d and gestures for police officers to come and remove him from the podium. Ronnie stated his satirical pseudonym in a, God forbid, mildly satirical manner, but the reaction of Leffingwell and the goons who removed him from the podium was a despicable and thuggish overreaction. When other citizens present at the council meeting start to vocally complain about Ronnie\u2019s treatment, Mayor Leffingwell calls for order and then threatens them, \u201csit down, be quiet, or you\u2019ll be next.\u201d\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/mayor-orders-cops-to-remove-citizen-at-council-meeting-for-stating-his-name\r\n\r\nRon Paul: People Will Go in the Street in Response to Inflation Tax\r\nInfowars.com\r\nAugust 26, 2011\r\n\r\nRon Paul told Lou Dobbs yesterday that the inflation tax \u2013 printing more money and expanding the monetary base \u2013 will result in people going in the street. Paul made his comment following large demonstrations and riots in Europe in response to the engineered global economic implosion. In France, on May Day, more than three million people attended 300 rallies against President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s economic recovery plan. The demonstrations followed Sarkozy\u2019s announcement that the French government plans to implement austerity measures, including spending cuts and tax increases. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an inflation tax to hit us and I am just afraid there will be people in the streets when they don\u2019t get what they want,\u201d Paul told the Fox Business Network.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/ron-paul-people-will-go-in-the-street-in-response-to-inflation-tax\r\n\r\nObama Issues Preemptive Emergency Declaration For North Carolina, NYC Transit To Shut Down Saturday\r\nBusiness Insider\r\nAugust 26, 2011\r\n\r\nThe eye of hurricane Irene remains near the Bahamas, but already President Barack Obama has signed an emergency disaster declaration for North Carolina. The North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks are expected to take the brunt of the storm at its strongest point on Saturday \u2014 with latest predictions placing the center of the storm passing over New York City as a Category 1 hurricane late Sunday. The declaration authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist in evacuation and response as it deems necessary. \u201cSpecifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding.\u201d The New York City transit system is expected to shut down bus, train and subway service once winds reach 39 miles per hour \u2014 which may occur as soon as Saturday. Additionally, bridges across the tri-state New York area may be closed if high winds make them too dangerous to pass. If the storm continues on its present track, Obama will likely issue similar preemptive declarations in the next day or two.\r\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/obama-preemptively-issues-emergency-declaration-for-north-carolina-2011-8\r\n\r\nFDA wages secret war on raw milk farmers using KGB-style spying and infiltration techniques\r\nInfowars.com\r\nAugust 25, 2011\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of investigation, NaturalNews can now reveal that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is waging a clandestine war on raw milk dairy farmers through a network of government spies who are coached on infiltration and social engineering techniques. Resembling the Stasi East German police or KGB of the former Soviet Union, these undercover FDA agents meet each month for a \u201cspying roundtable\u201d phone conference called the Raw Milk Call during which techniques of infiltration are openly discussed and encouraged. NaturalNews can now reveal that the majority of these undercover FDA agents are women, who are more easily able to infiltrate the raw dairy community with techniques of social engineering (see below). The existence of this elaborate spying operation has been confirmed by NaturalNews through three different sources, all of which demanded anonymity as they fear being targeted by the FDA with armed raids, false arrest and destruction of their property, as we recently witnessed with the Rawesome Foods raid. One source told NaturalNews they feared the FDA would stage a Waco-style siege of their farm and invent some justification to assault their farmhouse and shoot them and their family. Yes, this is how much freedom has been lost in America today, where farmers are afraid to speak out for fear they might be killed. And yet, it\u2019s not paranoia: They have legitimate reason to fear their own government is targeting them for termination.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/fda-wages-secret-war-on-raw-milk-farmers-using-kgb-style-spying-and-infiltration-techniques\r\n\r\nBig Sis Gives Green Light For Drone That Tazes Suspects From Above\r\nMini chopper can also carry shotguns and grenade launchers\r\nInfowars.com\r\nAugust 24, 2011\r\n\r\nThe Department of Homeland Security has given the green light for police departments in the United States to deploy a drone helicopter that has the ability to taze suspects from above as well as carrying 12-gauge shotguns and grenade launchers.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/big-sis-gives-green-light-for-drone-that-tazes-suspects-from-above\r\n\r\n5 Reasons Why American Riots Will Be The Worst In The World\r\nDont-tread-on.me\r\nAugust 10, 2011\r\n\r\nI wrote an article called 5 Places NOT To Be When The Dollar Collapses. In it I wrote that societies that benefited the most from the dollar would be the worst places to be when it fell apart. While the dollar has not even collapsed yet, the strain in these areas is becoming more apparent. England is number 3 on the list has had 4 days of violent riots as people start to lose it. Israel is number 1 on that list has had massive protests. There is revolution in the air all over the world except in the US. America is still in deep denial which is still the first stage of the Awakening. This denial will be wiped away when the dollar collapses. For now the economy is still functioning with food and fuel available. Americans still have the illusion of wealth and normalcy. They still are stuck in the false left right paradigm and think some other sock puppet will turn things around. When the dollar collapses, all American illusions will collapse with it. Deep denial will turn into deep anger. The violence I expect in the other 3 areas on the list and all urban areas in the US, will make all other global riots pale in comparison. America is deeply infused with arrogance, denial, narcissism, drugs and violence. There is no other society that I know of that has the degree of intensity and combination of these factors.\r\nhttp://dont-tread-on.me/5-reasons-why-american-riots-will-be-the-worst-in-the-world", "group_id": 3920, "id": 2113153}]
