Nor have its operatives manifested any ability to design anything as sophisticated as the Stuxnet worm. \u201cBut it is possible for a terrorist group to develop cyberattack tools on their own or to buy them on the black market,\u201d Lynn, the Pentagon\u2019s point man on cybersecurity, warned on Tuesday. \u201cAs you know better than I, a couple dozen talented programmers wearing flip-flops and drinking Red Bull can do a lot of damage.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaybe so. But in last week\u2019s congressional mega-hearing from the nation\u2019s intelligence leaders on threats facing the country, no spymaster assessed that al-Qaeda was looking to launch a giant cyberattack. The most likely forecasted method of terrorist assault against the U.S. are \u201csmall-scale attacks\u201d like homemade bombs, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a House panel. al-Qaeda appears more focused on making inroads to unsuspecting Muslim youth through social media.\r\n\r\nLynn left little doubt he had a worm like Stuxnet in mind, even though he didn\u2019t mention it by name. He warned about the \u201caccidental release of toxic malware\u201d in which \u201csomething as trivial as a thumb drive stuck in the wrong computer\u201d could have \u201ca calamitous effect on the global economy.\u201d What\u2019s that sound like to you?\r\n\r\nPerhaps Lynn has good reason to worry about the worm, even if he didn\u2019t mention it by name. Before Stuxnet, cyberattacks against government facilities tasted like small beer \u2014 defacing someone\u2019s website, or distributed denial of service overloads to bring the site down. But that was before a piece of malware managed to disrupt the industrial control systems spinning the centrifuges of Iranian nuclear facilities.\r\n\r\nWhile no one quite knows who designed Stuxnet, there\u2019s circumstantial evidence that it was a joint U.S.-Israeli jam. If so, then Lynn\u2019s warning about a terrorist group acquiring a cyberweapon of comparable potency would be painfully ironic.\r\n\r\nLynn reiterated the government\u2019s position that securing the Internet is properly a civilian concern \u2014 with the military waiting in the wings to assist. He said that he\u2019d expand a pilot program, called the Information Technology Exchange Program, to bring together military and private-industry experts in information technology and cybersecurity. Declan McCullagh of Privacy Inc. at CNet has some reservations on civil libertarian grounds.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/02/pentagon-deputy-what-if-al-qaeda-got-stuxnet", "group_id": 3920, "id": 129496}]
