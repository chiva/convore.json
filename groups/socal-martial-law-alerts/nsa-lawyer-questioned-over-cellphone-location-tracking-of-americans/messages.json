According to the general counsel of the National Security Agency, it may have that authority. Matthew Olsen, who is currently at the NSA and has been nominated to lead the National Counterterrorism Center, discussed the possibility at a confirmation hearing Tuesday morning in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \u201cThere are certain circumstances where that authority may exist,\u201d he said. His comments came after Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked him several times whether the government has the authority to \u201cuse cell site data to track the location of Americans inside the country.\u201d Although Olsen acknowledged the possibility, he also said \u201cit is a very complicated question\u201d and that the intelligence community is working on a memo that will provide a better answer for the committee.\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/07/26/nsa-lawyer-questioned-over-cellphone-location-tracking-of-americans/?mod=google_news_blog", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1729549}]
