And they definitely bungled the character of Cole a bit -- he was a bland and generic hero in the first game, but their attempts to turn him into some emotionally scarred tough-guy in the sequel just leaves him coming across as a total douche, even when you play the \"good\" path.\n\nThat being said, there are areas where this game excels like no other. The powers are incredibly fun, and I don't think any other game I've played has been so successful in making me feel like a dude with superpowers -- the developers of every other superhero game need to play this and take notes.
