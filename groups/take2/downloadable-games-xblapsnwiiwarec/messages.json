A twin-stick shooter that owes *more than a little* to Wanako's Assault Heroes franchise, albeit leaning slightly towards bullet hell territory.  The whole presented with a pleasingly crisp steampunk aesthetic and a more streamlined control system (as compared to Assault Heroes).\n\nHowever, the demo as a whole failed to convince.  It's\u2026\u00a0OK, but I'm not sure it's worth the M$1200 asking price.  I see Eurogamer just awarded it a 5, which I feel is maybe a *little* harsh\u2026\u00a0but then, I did only play the demo.", "group_id": 9493, "id": 1023818}, {"user_id": 33318, "stars": [], "topic_id": 34931, "date_created": 1305499644.420891, "message": "DLC can go in here too right?
