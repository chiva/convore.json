Its available gameplay modes, its menu structure, the career progression\u2026\u00a0everything is much more DiRT than DiRT 2.\n\nWhich, of course, is not a bad thing.

Sitting in a serenely animated DiRT 3 menu, listening to ambient electro or (of all things) smooth J-pop, I really really do miss DiRT 2's clashing guitars, phase-shifting audio, screen shakes and adrenaline-pumping fireworks.  It's almost as if I'm\u2026\u00a0halfway back to can-I-fall-asleep-now Gran Turismo.\n\nWhich, again, isn't a bad thing in and of itself, but it does make the game feel a little disjointed, *because* it still includes a fair number of X-Games events.
