I did find it a little too easy to accidentally activate the rear touch pad. Not a huge inconvenience (it's easy to adjust), but I blew quite a few power-ups in Super Stardust that way.\n\nThe front (capacitive) touch screen is a pretty unobtrusive addition. For the most part, I've seen it being used for interface stuff, such as tapping a map icon on the screen. Hardly essential, but sometimes it just seemed more natural to tap the screen for quick access to something. \n\nThe analog sticks are ... about as good as you might expect given the system's size. They feel a little flimsy, and aren't deep enough to match the range of, say, the Dual Shock, though they're certainly better than the PSP's awkwardly placed nubbin. The biggest surprise? The Vita is much lighter than you think.\n\nGraphically, I think \"PS3-level\" is an exaggeration at this point.
