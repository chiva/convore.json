Plus both subscriptions and MS points are more expensive locally.\n\nAs for XBLA games, the answer is \"kind of\". XBLA games aren't just locked to a profile, but also a specific console. If you're playing on the console on which the game was originally purchased and downloaded, then the game is available in full to all profiles on that console. However, once the console gets replaced, it'll only be available to the profile which purchased it, and only when that profile is connected to Live.
