I don't even know. Probably Space Channel 5. It takes you on a breathtaking aesthetic journey that begins with strange, abstractly tribal landscapes and majestically solemn religious imagery before cartwheeling off in completely unexpected directions. The only thing that even remotely compares to it in terms of visual impact is Child of Eden. El Shaddai isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be; it's unique, and that's much more important. \"", "group_id": 9493, "id": 1255257}, {"user_id": 33191, "stars": [], "topic_id": 37691, "date_created": 1306949737.642719, "message": "Yeah.
