I also have the Makefile and usr/bin/textrevise in my tarball: txtrevise_1.1.original.tar.gz.\r\n\r\nHowever when I build this and look inside of the Debian package, txtrevise is always at the root of the package instead of under usr/bin and will be installed to / instead of /usr/bin.\r\n\r\nHow can I get debuild to put the script in the right place?\r\n\r\nThanks.
