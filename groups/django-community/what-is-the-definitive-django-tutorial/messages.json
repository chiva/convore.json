That tutorial walks you through a typical Rails environment including the installation of RVM, Ruby 1.9.2, connecting to Github and deploying to Heroku.  I'm envisioning something that begins with a Python installation, followed by setting up virtualenv and pip and then installing Django, mod_wsgi, etc.  Would love to help out on something like this for Django if nothing exists currently.
