You can create a task on an event, without really wanting to inspect at that time if the event happened before. When the task is being processed, you will want to inspect the queue for others and either group them together or discard dupes. This can happen with errors, emails but can also happen for reports. Imagine a single report triggered by 3 different users, you want the report to run once and then notify those 3 users that it's ready. This isn't the only use case... That said, it's probably a bit niche anyway :)", "group_id": 81, "id": 992946}]
