If I reload the web page, or stop Firefox and restart it, the rule is once again only triggered once upon the first use of the bookmarklet. Using the bookmarklet a second time triggers the rule 3 times. The third use of the bookmarklet triggers the rule 6 times; the fourth  triggers 10 times. The number of triggers turns out to be a mathematical progression that equals the number of triggers raised in the previous use of the bookmarklet + the number of times the bookmarklet has been used since the last reload. What can I be doing wrong?  How do I debug what is causing the triggers to occur?", "group_id": 236, "id": 1886584}, {"user_id": 30559, "stars": [], "topic_id": 43909, "date_created": 1313530463.680469, "message": "This is a known issue and we are currently working on a fix for the problem.
