I've had issues with this for years.  The default mouse acceleration is odd and unnatural and there is no option to turn it off (it's standard to want no mouse acceleration for gaming).  Third party mice have bizarre behavior if they have a high polling rate (documented here http://dae.cyberic.eu/blog/mouse-cursor-skipping-jumping-bug-on-mac-os-x/ ). Third party mice have to rely on software to perform correctly, but that software is almost always buggy and problematic.  All the while, mouse control when I'm in bootcamp has been plug-and-play and problem free no matter what mouse I've used.  I feel like this is an extremely basic thing for an OS to have so many problems with and it's always frustrated me.  Am I alone on this/have you found workarounds for these problems?", "group_id": 1295, "id": 348607}, {"user_id": 20912, "stars": [], "topic_id": 13020, "date_created": 1300119048.757941, "message": "I agree with you.
