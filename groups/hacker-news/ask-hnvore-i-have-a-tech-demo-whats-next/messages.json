My cofounder and I have created a successful small business based on our first idea (a really easy to use CMS... how original right? it _is_ quite good though :)  As of Friday I have an idea that I think has some _very serious_ legs; and I created a tech demo this weekend to prove my idea will work.  The problem is that this idea will require a significant amount of capital, and a very different business than our first (disrupting an established competitor and all...).  We have a little money, probably enough to launch in a small area and get some initial users, but not enough to get the entire product and launch where it needs to be. [I apologize for being so vague, if you have questions I'll answer as best as I can w/o giving up the idea]\n\nHow much should I do before I start looking for angel investment? MVP? or is the tech demo enough? How much research are people who _aren't_ YC, or TechStars, etc looking for?  I think we're at the state where YC could make a lot of sense (if they'd have us..) but that's not for several months, and I won't wait around :)  Any ideas?", "group_id": 95, "id": 1448601}, {"user_id": 7517, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39978, "date_created": 1308681797.165714, "message": "Cant' help but love the HNVore topic!", "group_id": 95, "id": 1450820}]
