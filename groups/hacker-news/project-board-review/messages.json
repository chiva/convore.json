I've had several projects going at a time lately, but with down time between them while waiting for others to complete tasks...thats what gave me the idea for this.\n\nLike I said, it's pretty simple, but it works well for me. I figured I'd submit it here and get some real world feedback on how I can improve it.\n\nFYI, It's all HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I used localStorage to persist data between sessions.", "group_id": 95, "id": 1700125}]
