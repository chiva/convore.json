This is when it's connected via firewire 800. When connected with the same cable to my older 24\" iMac the drobo works ok. I can run other external hard drives via firewire 800 on my Mac Pro without issues. I like the concept of the drobo but I'm not sure I can trust it and I know I can't use it on my Mac Pro.", "group_id": 8778, "id": 643294}]
