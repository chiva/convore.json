I don't remember if I created a syncables account before, so I tried to \"sign in\" with my email address before I went ahead and created a new account.

I would recommend tweaking the user experience here to make it more obvious what's going on and what I can do to fix it.", "group_id": 4935, "id": 221136}, {"user_id": 15158, "stars": [], "topic_id": 9408, "date_created": 1299240565.4212129, "message": "Yikes, appreciate the feedback however Max! We submitted your suggestion to our VP of Engineering. U/X is very, very important to us, especially since we imagine that LivePlay will attract a new user-base to the Syncables family and many will be like yourself and not have a Syncables account. So, we need to get that experience right. Were you able to get around this at all and create a new Syncables account since?", "group_id": 4935, "id": 269061}]
