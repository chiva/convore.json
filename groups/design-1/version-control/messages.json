None of them is expensive compare dto tradional DAM solutions if you are working in a team settings. If you are solo, you will benefit from versioning your key milestones but not every save. It is somewhat limited value for a solo designer to be versioning. How about sharing versions with your clients ? One of my designer friend in Milwaukee  uses one of these versioning system to have his clients access his files.  A  $100 piece of software to manage your most important intellectual property should not be seen as expensive...it should be seen as an investment.
