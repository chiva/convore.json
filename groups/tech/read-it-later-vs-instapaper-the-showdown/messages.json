Saving articles to read later in a pleasant, uncluttered format, online or off, is the number one thing I do with the Internet and my various devices.

I think that RIL is more polished and has more (useful) features than Instapaper. The minimalist interface of Instapaper is nice (and their 1-paragraph article view is useful), but RIL is fast and practical for heavy reading, and also has a cool digest-mode where articles are organized in a flipboard-like view. Anyway, both are very close in terms of functionality, but I personally prefer RIL's UI.\n\nWhat bothers me is that some apps only support one (Pulse News for example only supports Instapaper).
