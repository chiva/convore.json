Between the standard camera app, Hipstamatic and Instagram, photography just seems more immediate and more fun with the phone.

Unless you are shooting stuff you need to blow up why not.   Heck I have a Canon 5D and lens that only gets used for special occasions now.  I would recommend that if you do buy a compact camera get one like the Pentax Optio w90.  It is waterproof and I know you can't use your phone for that.  Other than that I'm with you...the phone gets more use and most people don't need more than that.", "group_id": 97, "id": 447437}]
