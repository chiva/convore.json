You have to register with drop box and download the software. Install this software on system 1 (say office) and login using your credentials. This will create a folder in System 1. Do the same in System 2 (say home). Both the system will now have a folder in a path you specified while installing. You can copy the files you want to share into this folder and later access it from the other system. The files are actually shared on the dropbox servers. So if it is a big file it will take time to upload nad download. EHile uploading dropbox shows a spinner on the file and once it is over a green tick.
