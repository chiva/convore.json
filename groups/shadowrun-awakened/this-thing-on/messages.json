The assets we need most are humanoids, a few weapons, buildings, maybe doors, things that I know should be reusable and applicable to any more advanced incarnation of the game.

First, I think there is some misconception about what Arena Brawl is. It's not really a bowl or a sports arena, which is very confusing given the name (which we didn't make up). It's supposed to be an urban setting, a place amongst various abandoned buildings and ruins, where a game of the streets takes place. The idea itself is a little over the top, that people would risk their lives to compete in a guns-out team sports game, granted. We are massaging the original idea to include more elements beyond the simple rules of scoring goals with a ball or incapacitating the other team (i.e. deathmatch).", "group_id": 4266, "id": 1108467}]
