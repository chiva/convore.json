These is no replacement for seeing the cars in person, it's pretty amazing. I do agree with you on the overtaking, they keep changing the rules to try and make it better but they pretty much wind up with the exact same results in regards to the amount of overtaking. Do you follow the American Le Mans series at all? There has been a lot of hype lately over the new media package. It's basically web streaming with a race summary aired after the race.", "group_id": 2743, "id": 499072}, {"user_id": 25968, "stars": [], "topic_id": 15719, "date_created": 1301629273.220098, "message": "Bad hype, not good hype", "group_id": 2743, "id": 499077}]
