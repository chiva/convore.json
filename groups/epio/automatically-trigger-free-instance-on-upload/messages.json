When I upload a new version of my app and open it in the browser, I have to wait for the instance to spin up. Would it be possible to go ahead and load the dynamic instance as soon as a new upload is received? Most of the time you're just going to open it up anyways, and this would make the development experience a lot more seamless.", "group_id": 2873, "id": 2541419}, {"user_id": 34637, "stars": [], "topic_id": 47668, "date_created": 1321191697.521889, "message": "Maybe.
