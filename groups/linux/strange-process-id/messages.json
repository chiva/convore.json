I have a protocol which I need to extend with the ability to get the Process ID of a running process. I changed the code, built it and now I get my process ID. But I get a big number: 1188396544. All running processes have 4 or 5 digits. I use a system integrated struct with pid and I was curious if I need to convert this number, if there are problems with signed and unsigned, or something like that. (I had a similar problem with an IP, and It turned out, that I had to convert it to hex, change the order, ...) Any Ideas?", "group_id": 1042, "id": 481729}]
