Just looking at the car its difficult for many to see the attraction (extruded aluminium, little sound or heat proofing, fit lines only TVR would be proud of), but once you get in one its astoundingly comfortable (more so now with Probax seats) and everything is right where you need it to be. Driving and handling is as if you are telepathically connected to the car, the lack of power steering creating a far more intimate experience. Of course the 1.8L Rover or Toyota engine doesn't give you a huge amount of power, but its so light you dont really notice it - unlike the noise from the engine. It also leaked like a sieve and getting my 6ft 4' frame out of it with the hood up was a challenge to say the least.", "group_id": 9269, "id": 797528}, {"user_id": 2382, "stars": [], "topic_id": 21145, "date_created": 1303690327.1835561, "message": "Currently I'm thinking about a Europa, one of the 225's rather than the 70's model, which borders on practical although it wasn't especially beloved when it was released. The Evora it tempting, but the price for what the new management are treating as a stopgap has rather put me off. A late model Esprit could be fun, but they really were the last Lotuses kludged together out of whatever was in the parts bin that week.", "group_id": 9269, "id": 797547}, {"user_id": 2382, "stars": [], "topic_id": 21145, "date_created": 1303689087.900028, "message": "I was about six or seven, on a family holiday in Wales and a day trip to Portmerion during a Prisoner convention and there were no small number of Sevens and Caterhams warping my young mind, almost a child's ideal of what a car should look like - a rectangle with four wheels, two seats and an engine. Totally impractical but for a long time, my dream car.", "group_id": 9269, "id": 797487}]
