I like how you've broken it down for different audiences, as I think that's what kept tripping us up last week. We wanted process, but also elevator pitch, etc. Two thoughts I had: 1) I think it's really difficult for content to directly help with sales, so I'd feel more comfortable if there were additional objectives listed that are such as: engagement, interactions, retention, etc. and 2) I like the \"CS takes away pain\" section, but would like to see it also take social into account and not be on-site focused. Facebook/Twitter posts are content too and need strategising just as much for the reasons you mention. Nice work!", "group_id": 1409, "id": 698796}]
