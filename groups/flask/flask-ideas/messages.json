Obviously it can't really be tied to a particular ORM, but if it was configurable/pluggable and could default to a .htaccess file or something but could easily be adapted to use SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, or whatever other storage mechanism you happened to be using for your project, I think that could be very helpful.
