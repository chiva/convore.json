Like basecamp messages.  Perhaps only revealing the email to members of that group. Users could save the group name in their contacts, and an email to that topic will post to the topic.  And then, when an MP3 is emailed into a topic page, it resolves into a player so that the audio can be played right in there.  TINYVOX would then be a great way to \"make Convore talk\" and we would be like, \"Join Convore for awesome audio groups\".  Anyhoo, that is my idea.", "group_id": 2780, "id": 264877}]
