Get a complete manicure set.  All those little tools help with shaping nails, removing calluses on the side of your thumb and forming playing surfaces on the tip of your fingers that can really hold strings.  Use lots of lotion - several times a day - to keep calluses from splitting or hang nails from forming.  This also helps those playing surfaces on your finger tips that strike the strings when forming chords or playing leads.  At least once a week you have to cut and file your nails.  The difference in striking angles between barre chords, open chords and leads means that your finger tip playing surfaces have to be supported by round nails that are below the calluses.  Proper finger care will improve you playing and lessen the pain.", "group_id": 6711, "id": 446009}]
