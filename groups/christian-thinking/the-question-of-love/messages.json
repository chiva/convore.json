I found some places that spoke of the second death in terms of the \nsecond life, first life was being physically born, second life is spiritually born, therefore death follows the \nsame pattern, just in reverse. Physical and then spiritual death. I don't know if I would agree or not with that\n idea. But what then is the second death? Ecclesiastes 9 says that the dead are without thought, 5For the living\n know that they will die, but(A) the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for(B) the memory of them \nis forgotten. If that's true, then there can't really be eternal torment because, well, I think you have to think\n something to be eternally tormented... for instance \"ow, this is really tormenting me\".\n\nFurther to this, the greek word translated or understood to mean eternal, isn't always used for eternity, it means\n pretty much \"age lasting\" It is used to describe both the long standing but temporal and the eternal. The word used\n in the septaguant (Greek translation of the original hebrew old testament) in Hebrew is Olam, it get's translated \nas aionios. When looking at how the greeks use the word Aionios extra biblically, they just never use it to denote \na sense of eternity (http://www.tentmaker.org/books/Aion_lim.html). So why would the seventy who translated the hebrew\nto greek translate the hebrew olam to mean eternal if that is not what the common usage of the word was understood to \nmean? This is true until it is applied to a subject that adds to the words intrinsic meaning, example, God.\n\nSome things to which the word Aion and its derivatives have been applied to which you can say have passed away. \n\n Now the Jews have lost their eternal excellency; Aaron and his sons have ceased from their priesthood; the Mosaic \nsystem is superseded by Christianity; the Jews no longer possess Canaan; David and his house have lost the throne \nof Israel; the Jewish temple is destroyed, and Jerusalem is wiped out as the holy city; the servants who were to \nbe bondmen forever are all free from their masters; Gehazi is cured of his leprosy; the stones are removed from \nJordan, and the smoke of Idumea no longer rises; the righteous do not posses the land promised them forever; \nsome of the hills and mountains have fallen, and the tooth of Time will one day gnaw the last of them into dust;\n the fire has expired from the Jewish altar; Jonah has escaped from his imprisonment; all these and numerous \nother eternal, everlasting things -- things that were to last forever, and to which the various aionian words \nare applied -- have now ended, and if these hundreds of instances must denote limited duration why should the \nfew times in which punishments are spoken of have any other meaning? \n\nIn the last third or so I took heavily from the url referenced above... but that was an interesting read for me, \neven if I did skim some of the material. \nI also pretty much got sidetracked from the idea of the second death except to link that idea of second death \nwith the idea of death and eternity in scripture, death being a state of no thought, no consciousness at \nall ...
