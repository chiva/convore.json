It is however something to ponder over.\n\n\nHow much faith do you demonstrate in your lifestyle?\n\nI have all the same as @LintonCaldecott but not sure that means I have no faith or am not living in faith. I think it's a problem if all those things get in the way of living generously? Does Proverbs not say something about a wise man saves for the future? I'll have to look it up (my awesome knowledge of the scriptures fails me). Granted a person with less has to exercise their reliance on God a lot more than someone that has all life's comforts.

Help me stand firm if You take it away.\" I worry that I will love what I have more than God.\n\n\nHow much time do you spend each day worrying?\n\nJeepers, no freakin' idea. I suppose I worry, I am human after all. What's important to me is what I do with that worry. When I have work deadlines like I have now, I worry if I will make it.

I totally cheated this time and didn't re-write what I had done a while back while studying this stuff, I scanned this in and OCR'd it. It is a lot, but it has much pertinence to the topic of the kingdom and discipleship and faith.\n\nbasileia and discipleship these themes are closely related. \nthe basileia, even if elusive, provides a vision, an ethic, and a practice for those of us who want to be\ndisciples.\nBasileia, a Greek New Testament term, is usually translated as God\u2019s\n'kingdom'. It could be translated as \u2018rule\u2019, or the place where God\u2019s active reign is found. But\nit\u2019s really about a lifestyle instead of a place, state or empire.\nThe Old Testament roots of the theme of basileia lie in the idea of Israel\nbeing a theocracy, i.e. a state or country ruled directly by God. lsrael\u2019s\nmission was to be a light to the Gentiles, with a vision that Zion would\nultimately be a home for all nations. Here, the reign of Yahweh is\nassociated with justice, wholeness of nature, abundance, joy, and peace.\nIt is a time when suffering and war will come to an end.\nThe Synoptic Gospels present basileia as the key theme of Jesus\u2019\nteaching. It is something that can be experienced in the present- even if\nonly partially- as well as something that will come with the fullness of\ntime. lt is perhaps because of the Johannine and Pauline writings that\nwe focus so much on the person of Jesus in our worship, sometimes to\nthe extent that we forget that Jesus proclaimed the basileia and not\nhimself.\n\nWe can get some idea of what Jesus means by basileia by looking at:\n\u2022\tthree special categories of people \u2014 the only groups of whom Jesus\n\u2022\tsaid the basileia is theirs already\n\u2022\tsome images of it provided in various parables\nl've chosen episodes where Jesus makes comparisons which would\nhave shocked, and in some cases, amused his audience. They are\nillustrations close to their experience \u2014 but you should also consider how\ndifferent segments of an audience would respond. We\u2019ve got used to\nreading these episodes in the Bible where they have been embedded in\nthe narrative framework created by the Gospel writers. So sometimes it's\nvery difficult for us to imagine being in an audience hearing these stories\nfor the first time. Perhaps we\u2019ve become too comfortable in the ways we\nread these texts. \n\n1.\tThe basileia is for children. \n(Mark 9:35-7, but notice context from 33 on; 10:13-16)\nThis suggests that the basileia is for the humble and vulnerable. But it\ngoes a little further than that. In Mediterranean society at the time of\nJesus children had little standing. Thus, Jesus is posing a deliberate\nchallenge to the disciples. Normally, for the disciples, and probably for\nus adults as well, we wouldn\u2019t like being called a child. But this ls\nwhom Jesus says the basileia is for.\n2.\tThe basileia is for the destitute: \u2018BIessed are the ptochoi\u2019.\n(Luke 6:20 and Matthew 5:3)  \nUsually, \u2018ptochoi\u201d is translated as \u2018poor\u2019. However, the usual word ln\nGreek for \u2018poor\u2019 is \u2018penes\u2019, which refers to those who, unlike the\nextremely wealthy, have to work to live. lt includes those who work as\nservants or as labourers in the households or on the estates of the\nsmall aristocratic class. lt also includes the peasant farming family\nwho has access to land but struggles to make a living from it. A\n\u2018Ptochoi\u201d, meaning \u2018one who crouches\u2019, actually means \u2018beggar\u2019.\nUnlike the \u2018poor', the \u2018beggar\u2019 lives on the margins of society \u2014 a\nhomeless wanderer without work and without a family to depend on.\nIn other words, the basileia is for the destitute, those who stand\noutside the relationships that govern family and labour for those who\nhave a social and economic place, however small, in society.\n3.\tThe basileia is for those who are persecuted for their\nrighteousness. (Matthew 5:10)\nRead in conjunction with the Old Testament, this refers to those who\nare persecuted because of their commitment to justice. Those in\npower, at the receiving end of prophetic criticism, would act against\nthose who questioned them. \u2018\n\nSo, this is who the basileia is for, and next we look at what the basileia is described as being.\n\n4.\tThe basileia is like a weed.\n(Mark 4:30-32 = Matthew 13:31-2; Luke13:18-19 = Matthew 13: 31-\n32. Matthew 13:24-30 + interpretation in 36-43a)\nThere are two parables where the basileia is compared to dangerous\nplants, the mustard tree (or bush) and darnel \u2014\u2014 although we might not\nhave thought of it in this way.\nMany of us will have heard ministers preaching as follows: \u2018The\nmustard tree has very small seeds. But from this small seed grows a\nmighty tree.\u2019 However, in Israel\u2019s view a mighty tree would be the\ncedar of Lebanon. \n'The point...is not just that the mustard plant starts as a\nproverbially small seed and grows into a shrub of three or\nfour feet, or even higher, it is that it tends to take over\nwhere it is not wanted, that it tends to get out of control,\nand that it tends to attract birds within cultivated areas\nwhere they are not particularly desired; And that, said\nJesus, was what the Kingdom was like: not like the mighty\ncedar of Lebanon and not quite like a common weed, like a\npungent shrub with dangerous takeover (i.e. invasive)\nproperties. Something you would want in only small and\ncarefully controlled doses - if you could control it.\u2018\nThe second story concerns the way in which darnel, a poisonous plant\nthat looks very much like wheat, grows naturally in wheat fields. The\nproblem for the rich landowner is how to separate the wheat from the\ndarnel. In wet years this problem is worse than in dryer years because the\ndarnel grows more prolifically. The point of this story seems to be that the\nlandowner and those (servants and labourers) who work the estates are\nstuck with this problem, just as they are stuck with the basileia.\nPresumably, the landless poor would have enjoyed the point of this tale.\n5.\tThe basileia is like leaven.\n(Luke 3:20-1 = Matthew 13:33)\nThis is the last example l\u2019ll offer. Why would this story offend? Well,\nwomen were subject to purity codes within Jewish law, and so was\nleaven - it was regarded as unclean and had to be cleared out of the\nhousehold for the duration of the Passover. At the time of Jesus\nleaven was made by women by placing a piece of fermenting bread in\na dark place so that the cells of the yeast fungus would develop further\nin the bread. Then, small quantities of this leaven would be placed\ninside the dough before new bread was baked. What Jesus appears to\nhave been saying is that the basileia is associated with women and\nleaven, both of which were regulated by the religious code of the time.\nBoth are natural and normal, but society feels uncomfortable. There is\na fear that women and leaven may be corrupting. So, the basileia is\nhidden within society or the world much as leaven is hidden in dough.\nFrom here it acts on and brings about a fundamental change - just as\nthe bread rises.\nThus, in the first three illustrations, the basileia confronts us with God\u2019s\nelusive presence. The stories about it and how we can receive it remind\nus that it is not through any merit of our own. indeed they illustrate how\nGod\u2019s love reaches out to those who are most vulnerable, those \u2018who\ncome to God\u2019s presence with empty hands.\u2019 ln\nthe set of images that follow the basileia is presented as something that\nis contagious and invasive, that infects its surroundings. lt cannot be\ncontrolled. ln fact, it discomforts us with its vision that places those on\nthe margins in our societies at its very centre. its ability to destabilise our\nsense of reality and undermine sets of relationships which we take as\nnormal can be quite terrifying. lt often seems that we can only cope with\nsmall doses of it. Perhaps this is why we so often ignore the economic,\nsocial, and political nature of the claims of God on our lives. We find\nthem too radical, too egalitarian, too inclusive. Perhaps this is why we\nsometimes hasten to insist that small encounters with the basileia are\nenough, that this is all we can expect, that it\u2019s future coming in all its\nfullness is in the hands of God.\n\nBut the challenge of the basileia is not only that it presents us with a\nvision of how things could be. lt shows us how things are in the basiliea.\nAnd, if we wish to live faithfully, then we need to live like this as well. So,\neven as it critiques our lives against its realities, it provides us with a\nsocial ethic and a social practice that we are called to follow. For many\nbiblical and theological scholars, this requires us to shift our concern for\n\u2018right teaching\u2019 (orthodoxy) to \u2018right practice\u2019 (orthopraxis).\nThus, in CRE, we need to be aware that we are educating people to\nparticipate in the basileia \u2014\u2014 it is both the means and the ends of our\ndiscipleship. Some themes which we need to be aware of include:\n1. The basileia breaks into our lives as kairos, decisive moments that\nrequire decisions that have profound implications for our lives. The\ncall to discipleship doesn\u2019t happen only once \u2014 each moment of kairos\ncalls us to make that decision again and again as we consider how to\nrespond faithfully to new situations.\n2. The implication of this first point is that our conversion (metanoia) is\nparticipative and ongoing. It happens in community (koinonia) and it\nrequires service (diakonia). lt is, in fact, our constant conversion\ntowards both God and neighbour; my love for God fails when I fail to\nlove my neighbour. And everyone, including those l see as enemies,\nare my neighbours.\n3. But these social consequences of the basileia need to be extended\nbeyond a concern for people and society. The critical question is: Am\nI striving to live in love, justice, and peace with the whole of creation?\n4. One final point. The Church (ecclesia) exists for the sake of the\nbasileia, and not the other way around. This subordination of the\nchurch to the basileia means that we have to remember that God is at\nwork outside of the Church as well. Indeed, in terms of our faith, God\nis at work throughout the whole of creation. So, salvation is not the\nmonopololy of Christians or the Church \u2014\u2014 others are able to perform\nacts of loving service towards their neighbours without thought of\nreward. And, our own perspective is limited. We cannot claim to know\nthe mind of God and we don\u2019t fully understand just how God is at work\nin the world.\n\nOne way of gaining insight into discipleship is to use the Gospel of Mark.\nHere, the author\u2019s narrative strategy seems to have been that we learn\nabout discipleship by seeing how hard it is. Thus, the disciples tend to be\nshown in a poor light- they are slow to understand, squabble among\nthemselves, and are jealous of the success of others.
