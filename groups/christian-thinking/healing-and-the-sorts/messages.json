If you want my notes just let me know and I can mail them to you. I left there with questions though. I heard a lot of \"small\" ailments being healed but not the wheel chair bound lady. One Cerebral palsy lady claimed she could move her hand more, that in fact it was 70% better.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Does God not heal 100%? I was pointed to Mark 8:24 to show that He does not always.\n2. Why does it seem that all \"smaller\" healing happen at these things but the lady in the wheel chair stays in the chair? I wonder sometimes how that person must feel. Everyone is healed and God side stepped her.\n3. Does the healing that happens depends on the faithfulness of the receiver?", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1437769}, {"user_id": 32888, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39857, "date_created": 1308577560.3662331, "message": "I guess by extension the Luke 23:40-43 is similar", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1438445}, {"user_id": 32888, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39857, "date_created": 1308574736.883122, "message": "Technically, God doesn't heal 100% here and now because everyone dies. The cure for death is something that happens after death I guess. That implies all healing is partial in this life. Unless that lady was healed of her CP, then what happened was an easing of her pain perhaps? I am not going to say God can't or won't... or even that I have to see a reason for what he does. I am a sceptic though, and things like that always get my cynicism furnace burning hotter. I equate that kind of thing to the \"power balance\" video's (if you don't know of them, go and watch them. \n\nAs for the Mark 8:24 text, that is once again taken out of the larger text to add weight to an argument,  if you read the preceding and following verses you find an interesting thing. Jesus is speaking about the blindness of his disciples, bringing to mind their failure to see and understand. Jesus spits on the mans eyes, lays hands on him and asks him about his sight, it is imperfect, then Jesus places his hands on him again and there is healing. Jesus did heal the man properly in this text, he just did it in a different manner, and it is congruent with the apparent lesson of the earlier text, it's not about Jesus having to practice healing to get better at it, and it's not about Jesus being a demonstration of a try try again mentality. It's not even principally about the physical healing I don't think.\n\nAs for the lady that wasn't healed while around her more \"minor\" healings were taking place, if I am totally honest, my initial reaction is that it's charlatanism going on. But I must concede that God has his reasons, and it could be that he has a greater purpose for her in the wheelchair? Perhaps the people doing the healings feared their own lack of faith? I don't know.\n\nThere are a few texts that indicate that the faith of the healed is responsible for the healing etc. Mark 10, luke 7 and luke 18 luke 17 (mark and luke accounts the same event)", "group_id": 9787, "id": 1438181}, {"user_id": 13817, "stars": [], "topic_id": 39857, "date_created": 1308577312.047214, "message": "@LintonCaldecott Thanks.

Is that why it never happened? Why did God almost heal everyone with small ailments and the lager ones were either a \"half job\" or completely ignored?\n\nI know I can only really get guess answers here. Since none of us can really know what happened there or what God did or did not choose to do. I just wonder if there is a biblical president that I can measure with. Is it fair for me to say I don't think it was God if it does not measure up to <whatever>?

Specific times to fulfil His specific purpose.\n\nWe all seem to agree, it's not about the physical healing, it's about spiritual healing.

He manipulated elements into other substances, he calmed the turmoil of a raging storm, he multiplied food, he healed people actively and passively (lady with the bleeding problem) he brought people back from the dead and he came back from the dead himself. He then calmly tells his disciples that they would do even greater things than these.

To produce the new creature is a more glorious effect, than merely to produce a creature.\u2014Making a holy creature, a creature in the spiritual image of God, in the image of the divine excellencies, and a partaker of the divine nature\u2014is a greater effect than merely to give being.
