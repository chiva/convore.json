Standouts include the opener Firewall, and Haile Selassie, a nice departure from much of Bright Eyes' past fare. The album's first single, Shell Games, is a great listen but doesn't have a lot of staying power. The album is streaming in its entirety on the band's YouTube: http://youtu.be/yVyxRNc_gTs", "group_id": 4897, "id": 185928}]
