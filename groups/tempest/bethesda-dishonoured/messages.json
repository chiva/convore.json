It's a game about infiltration where you can set up traps and slaughter the entire garrison of an aristocrat's mansion rather than sneak in. It's a game about brutal violence where you can slip in and out of a fortified barracks with nobody ever knowing you were there. It's a game about morality and player choice where the world you create is based on your actions, not navigating conversation trees.\"", "group_id": 6442, "id": 1586139}, {"user_id": 23428, "stars": [], "topic_id": 41385, "date_created": 1310086696.6990759, "message": "They aren't developing it though and Bethesda published games have had their fair share of shockers.", "group_id": 6442, "id": 1589102}, {"user_id": 22509, "stars": [], "topic_id": 41385, "date_created": 1310136213.994931, "message": "true. still sound sinteresting", "group_id": 6442, "id": 1593265}, {"user_id": 22504, "stars": [], "topic_id": 41385, "date_created": 1310265032.0256801, "message": "sounds groovy", "group_id": 6442, "id": 1602378}]
