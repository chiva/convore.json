The MC changes, and thereby the OS is impacted directly through this change.\n\nHow does it work if the Main Character is not the Protagonist.  What links his/her growth to the OS through line?  For e.g. Shawshank Redemption.  Red is the MC, but it is Andy Dufresne  who drives the story.\n\nRed is a change character - but I was wondering if there was an appreciation the links in directly with the O.S. and somehow shapes that?  Or does it need to?\n\nOr is it related to the role they play in the O.S. (e.g. Sidekick or variation thereof)", "group_id": 2515, "id": 2182205}, {"user_id": 7645, "stars": [], "topic_id": 45613, "date_created": 1316622948.454165, "message": "Their Unique Ability is another way of tying them into the OS. Red shares the same problematic element that everyone in the story deals with - albeit from a different perspective (more personal). That would be the Crucial Element.
