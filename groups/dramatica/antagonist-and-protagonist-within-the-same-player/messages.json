It's about a teenage girl who tries to find love while trying to build up her independent life in a large city. She's in and out of relationships, lots of friends, drama and stuff happens. It's a typical romantic series. As I see all the dramatica archetypal characters appear in the story in one form or another except from two: the Antagonist and the contagonist. This girl is pretty much surrounded by friends and the story focuses on her friendships and romantic relationships generally getting messed up by her. Now the question: Is it possible in this case that the Main Character has the characteristics of both the protagonist and the antagonist. As I see she is the only reason why her relationships get messed up. I'd say: \"Her biggest enemy is herself\". Similar stuff applies to Bridget Jones I guess. There is basically no outer force which would make her miserable - it's herself who makes things wrong all the time (even if temptation looks like an outer force in this story). So is it possible? Protagonist and Antagonist in the same character? What do you think?", "group_id": 2515, "id": 1317834}, {"user_id": 30951, "stars": [], "topic_id": 38428, "date_created": 1307434528.0047309, "message": "Couple of comments from me.\n\nYou said: \"Is it possible in this case that the Main Character has the characteristics of both the protagonist and the antagonist.\"\n\nThe protagonist is not part of the Main Character. The protagonist is a OS character. The Main Character is whichever player is the audience's viewpoint on the story. Choices re. protagonist / antagonist are nothing to do with Main Character.\n\nIn Bridget Jones, I'd have thought the character played by Hugh Grant was the antagonist, but I see what you mean. Or, if not, I still wouldn't say it was her but perhaps 'society'. \n\nIt sounds to me like your story is not a complete story in the Dramatica sense. But, if protagonist and antagonist were in one character, I'm not sure an audience could have sympathy for a character like that. A of the conflict would be internal, not played out to the audience. Also, could this be a collection of many stories?", "group_id": 2515, "id": 1317999}, {"user_id": 35323, "stars": [], "topic_id": 38428, "date_created": 1307435178.870723, "message": "I understand that Protagonist is not part of the Main Character - the point is that it can be part of him.
