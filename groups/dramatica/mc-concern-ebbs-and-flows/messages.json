Is it my \"Choice\" to look at old newspapers that uncovers his Past? And my bad attitude that interferes?\n\n\nLet me attempt a reply and touch on all of the points.\n\nIn your first example \u201cthe clear up dad's conviction\u201d I'm not sure I erven see that as a \u201ctrue\u201d MC Concern. I see that as more of a \u201cOS Concern\u201d . My understanding is that the MC concern is more private. Unless I've really misunderstood something. Clarification anyone?\n\nAs for your \u201ccomment\u201d about benchmark \u201cmeasures how strong something is\u201d again that is not my understanding of \u201cbenchmark. My understanding of \u201cbenchmark\u201d is (I looked it mentions \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d) . For me the \u201cmeasuring stick is simply showing the points of  change not the speed at which we (MC) reaches those points or the force of the change. Again, clarification anyone.\n\nIf the interest is about \u201c the forces that affect the thing we are measuring.\u201d then I think we're in another area. Is this the IC or the OS arena? I suspect it falls more towared the IC.\n\nIn the example of the \u201cdaughter marrying into the mob\u201d \n\nI will suggest here that your example doesn't touch on the underlying MC Concern (as you conveyed it) because we don't get a sense of \u201cwhy\u201d you really don't want her to marry. - bad experience with mob in the past/ her by the mob/connection with the mob/fear of the mob because of something you did etc. Again, my understanding is that the MC Concern must me personal/private.\n\nNow then you mention that your Benchmark is the \u201cpast\u201d\n\nI want to digress for a second- \nI'm not sure whether you are looking at a \u201creport\u201d or not in bring up your examples. I quickly went through ALL of the reports and interestingly found only one (I admit I might have missed another) that uses \u201cbenchmark and that is \u201cKitchen Sink\u201d. (I'd always thought that kitchen sink was everything but apparently it is a beast unto itself) \n\nSo in Kitchen sink we get something like \u201cMain Character Concern / Benchmark\u201d\n\nIS THIS what we are looking at??? \nIf so I will posit that (perhaps)  the hint is in something that this report shows such as:\n...the degree of his concern is measured by how fully he accommodates The Past:\n\nthe past made him question his own decisions about what is good and evil [from one of my stories so it might be different from yours]\n\nSo If I'd fleshed out my story more the report might have indeed continued such as:\n \nin the past he was forced to make choices as he deliberated what was good and evil\n             actual scenes or memories of choices that forced him to either get more evil or fight evil\n             and now he/she sees these choices rising again only (in your example) morphed into much more serious choices for the daughter or raising the spectre that his daughters marriage will enliven the consequences of these earlier decsions.\n\nThat being said- I will suggest (because I can't remember ever seeing any detailed discussion on what this actual report verbage means) that this \u201creport\u201d is simply giving the writer the opportunity to \u201cshow\u201d the examples of the benchmarks that will illustrate  the MC Concern.", "group_id": 2515, "id": 198121}, {"user_id": 7664, "stars": [], "topic_id": 8519, "date_created": 1298570905.3420739, "message": "Your response is so long that it's going to be super-unwieldy trying to respond.
