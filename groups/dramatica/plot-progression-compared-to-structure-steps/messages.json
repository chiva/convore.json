If so, could it be used as a comparison to say, Truby's 7 step approach to structure, taking into the Dramatica throughline focus here?\n\nOr should I not see this as 7 steps? I remember reading that writers should use either the Signposts or the Journeys. Does that mean using both is not recommended? \n\nI'm curious because I can see the logic in dividing a story into 7 steps, as a precursor to a step / scene outline.", "group_id": 2515, "id": 876657}, {"user_id": 7645, "stars": [], "topic_id": 33060, "date_created": 1304315069.0179181, "message": "As for me I prefer to just look at the signposts and construct the story from there.
