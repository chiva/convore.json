(She's a change character, and the OS Solution is also control.)\n\nI've also imagined that she likes being in Control -- she's most comfortable when she's in control.\n\nThe thing that leaps to mind here is: if she's already always striving to be in control, can she have Control as a Solution?\n\nWhat I'm wondering specifically is this: Nobody ever really has control. We want it, but it's always an illusion. So, could her solution actually be \"try to have less control\"?\n\nI think that's a restating of \"give up the illusion of Control\", btw.\n\nI want to make sure that I'm not trying to solve \"Uncontrolled\" with ... \"uncontrolled.\"\n\nSamuelCPotter:\nThis is an area I would like to learn more about. Often in the Dramatica Users Group podcast I have hear Chris say (and I have to be careful here because often what I think I hear isn't quite right) ...I often hear him say something about the goal of obtaining could be about losing. My question is, once you take the opposite side there how does that effect the rest of the issues and elements, etc.\n\nSo if a solution is control which is no control does that automatically make the problem not enough un-control? And then do you need to take the opposite of the sympton and response? like an algebra problem where anything you do to one side you have to do to the other side of the equation?", "group_id": 2515, "id": 1716298}, {"user_id": 7664, "stars": [], "topic_id": 42640, "date_created": 1311610654.2762721, "message": "The thread got wildly away from the original question, so I'm reposting it here for a discussion about that.
