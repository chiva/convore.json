There's something I can't put my finger on that makes this one stand out... I think it's how lifelike its flight appears, and how well it glides. I'd like to see a good life-inspired Bat robot. They're incredibly nimble and far more precise than birds. But, given their appetites, I imagine this requires far more power to achieve.
