They want to try to get a younger audience, and so are looking for hip (cool, innovative, social impact, pretty, etc.) projects to publish on their website- much like Wired's current effort. I mentioned the rooftop garden and the quadcopter, and she seemed interested in both- she asked me to contact her and send pics/more details. This may be a good way to get some prestige for our group, though we have to be careful not to give away all of our secrets. She actually spent most of the talking to my girlfriend Jenn, whom I think she assumed belonged to the lab. Luckily, Jenn is well versed in tech and our projects, and made us sound very impressive.", "group_id": 9523, "id": 1609598}, {"user_id": 4330, "stars": [], "topic_id": 41620, "date_created": 1310359337.7902081, "message": "Cool!
