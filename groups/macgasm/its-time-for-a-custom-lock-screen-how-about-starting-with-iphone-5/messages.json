They aren\u2019t as single serving as an OS X widget, but they certainly aren\u2019t as robust as some desktop applications either. Apple\u2019s doing a lot to close that gap, as evidenced by Garageband and iMovie on the iPad, but we\u2019re still a little ways off at this point. But, OS X widgets in the dashboard are pretty much an abandoned technology. I don\u2019t know one person who uses them on a daily basis, and if you do, I\u2019d suggest that you\u2019re in the minority. Taking a moment to think about it, it becomes pretty obvious that the dashboard in OS X is an awful lot like the lock screen on the iPhone and iPad. They\u2019re both there, they\u2019re both accessible, and they\u2019re both rarely used for anything except checking the time (iOS) or loading a calculator (OS X). The key difference between the two is that we\u2019re forced to look at the lock screen at regular intervals whereas the dashboard rarely ever gets opened.\n\nWhat if Apple changed their approach to the lock screen? What if they took the widget approach from OS X, and directly applied it to the lock screen of the iPhone 5? Users could then add an email list, a to-do list, a calendar, or anything else that developers could squeeze into the newly widgetized space.\n\nI often find myself clicking my lock button just to check the time, but it would be incredibly more useful if I could click the lock button and see the weather, missed calls, or latest direct message from Twitter.", "group_id": 7274, "id": 400513}, {"user_id": 10716, "stars": [], "topic_id": 14252, "date_created": 1300729415.56181, "message": "should be an iOS feature and not restricted to hardware :) I also +1 this feature", "group_id": 7274, "id": 400556}, {"user_id": 18029, "stars": [], "topic_id": 14252, "date_created": 1300730004.817528, "message": "Agree, agree.
