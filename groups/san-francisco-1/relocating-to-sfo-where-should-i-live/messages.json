I am relocating to SFO (from Europe) in November and need your advice as I'm not sure where to live. I really like the South Beach area (also close to the office) but prices are ridiculous over there. So I've been looking around... One place that I also really like is Emeryville. You can get so much more for less money but then there's obviously the commute. So I'm kinda lost and thought I would ask you guys. So... Where should I live? Pay $$$$ for a small apartment? Or pay less for a nice big loft or house in Emeryville/the suburbs? Thanks in advance for your input ;-)", "group_id": 614, "id": 2035399}]
