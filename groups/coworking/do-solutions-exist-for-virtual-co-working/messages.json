There's a good summary at http://www.coworkingtoronto.ca/\n\nI was wondering if there's any online chat rooms or solutions for \"virtual\" co-working.\n\nTele-commuting and virtual meeting spaces are now common for people in the same company or team, but co-working is for individuals or individual \"teams\" to come together.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is #chat channels on irc, yet most of these are more Q & A oriented than let's do work and hang out together while doing it.\n\nDo such solutions exist?\n\nThanks!\n\n( I also posted this on Quora at http://www.quora.com/Coworking/Do-solutions-exist-for-Virtual-Co-working )", "group_id": 706, "id": 2422188}]
