Some used IRC but it never got a big following. Convore was chosen this year as kind of a new thing to try out and it was very well received. Most (if not all) attenders had laptops and a majority used the back chat because it was advertised by the conference management at every speech.

I just returned from two that used Twitter hashags for backchannel communication during the sessions. Every session used the same hashtag, and it was difficult at times to determine what people were discussing. The ability to create topics within a Convore group is a feature that efficiently keeps specific conversations organized (and perhaps even more focused). It might also prevent conversations from being hijacked. Also, the longer word limit associated with Convore would enable users to expand on their ideas. Overall, it appears to be a simple-to-use group communication tool.", "group_id": 7963, "id": 503988}]
