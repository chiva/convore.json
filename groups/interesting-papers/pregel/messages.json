It's a pretty neat implementation of a generic \"bridging model for parallel computing\" called Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) that was introduced by a dude named Leslie Valiant in the 80s. But it's being used in the context of a database, which is interesting. BSP is sort of like Map Reduce in that it gives programmers a way to write simple, straight-line code and then gives them a framework that lifts that code up to become parallel and distributed.", "group_id": 12, "id": 10076}, {"user_id": 1, "stars": [], "topic_id": 239, "date_created": 1288588659.9732399, "message": "It's been getting a lot of talk lately, and I still haven't taken the time to read it.", "group_id": 12, "id": 5225}, {"user_id": 1, "stars": [], "topic_id": 239, "date_created": 1288588647.3311391, "message": "Have you guys read this? http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1582716.1582723", "group_id": 12, "id": 5224}, {"user_id": 11, "stars": [], "topic_id": 239, "date_created": 1290015395.42347, "message": "Actually, BSP is really similar to an actor model.
