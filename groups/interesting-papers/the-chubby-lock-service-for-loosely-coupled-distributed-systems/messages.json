Chubby provides an interface much like a distributed \ufb01le system with advisory locks, but the design emphasis is on availability and reliability, as opposed to high performance. Many instances of the service have been used for over a year, with several of them each handling a few tens of thousands of clients concurrently. The paper describes the initial design and expected use, compares it with actual use, and explains how the design had to be modi\ufb01ed to accommodate the differences.", "group_id": 12, "id": 777318}, {"user_id": 719, "stars": [], "topic_id": 20786, "date_created": 1303436200.2259891, "message": "Doozer (https://github.com/ha/doozerd) was inspired by this paper.
