Mainstream parser generators pose restrictions on syntax de\ufb01nitions that follow from their implementation algorithm. They hamper evolution, maintainability, and compositionality of syntax de\ufb01nitions. The pureness and declarativity of syntax de\ufb01nitions is lost. We analyze how these problems arise for different aspects of syntax de\ufb01nitions, discuss their consequences for language engineers, and show how the pure and declarative nature of syntax de\ufb01nitions can be regained.", "group_id": 12, "id": 2383834}]
