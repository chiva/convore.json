Here's my suggestion for the improved methods. I wonder why they only chose engineering students none of whose learning style is 'textual'. The results might have been different if there had been some humanity students. Also, they measured 'the successful learning' by how much information the participant remembered, which is all about the short term memory. Above all, this research completely ignore the core factor of learning; the motivation. The participants were there to respond to certain contents in which they had no interests and engagement. They were seen as a passive 'receiver of the knowIege'. I believe 'motivation' factor can completely turn over the result. For example, 15 minutes or 25 minutes doesn't matter when I am interested in contents.

We tend to be too much textual. As we are basically dealing with abstract matters such as concepts and thoughts, there are bigger needs for diagram, mapping or pictures.

While one course instructor requried us to draw our own map of all the readings, the other one only required a textual summary of each reading. The difference was clear at the end of the semester.
