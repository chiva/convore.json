I promise you: this is the only time you\u2019re going to \nsee me in a Packers jersey,\u201d said Corbett. \u201cBut the governor of Wisconsin and I \nmade a bet, and when you make a bet you have to keep your word.\u201d \n \n\u201cAlthough my beloved Steelers lost the Super Bowl, I\u2019m happy to turn that loss into \na win for the children of the Pittsburgh region who are served by the Boys and Girls \nClubs of Western Pennsylvania and the Sarah Heinz House Boys & Girls Club,\u201d \nCorbett added. \n \nThe money was donated through the nationwide \u201cCoke Cheers\u201d promotion. The \npromotion raised funds for Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) to support Triple \nPlay, a national program created by BGCA and Coca-Cola to help kids eat healthier \nand become more physically active. \n \nThe ceremony was held at the Sarah Heinz House in Pittsburgh.

It runs best when \nstate government gets out of the way. And it grows best when we give it the \nclimate to do so. That\u2019s what my budget is about; keeping away from more taxes \nand freeing the private sector from red tape,\u201d said Corbett. \n \nCorbett\u2019s proposed budget cuts government spending by 3 percent, most of which \nis done by consolidating programs, targeting inefficiencies and reducing or \neliminating discretionary financial grants. \n \nThe budget refocuses and streamlines the state\u2019s support of free enterprise by \nsupporting programs that will encourage economic growth and job creation, \nstreamlining a multitude of business incentive programs, awarding tax credits as \nincentives for new and creative ideas to improve business and industry, and helping \nto expedite permit reviews in the agriculture industry to speed up projects that \ncreate jobs for farmers. \n \n\u201cThis business began as the Shreve Ice Cream Company in the downtown area. It \nwas a family business then. In 1914, the Galliker family bought it and it\u2019s still a \nfamily business,\u201d said Corbett. \u201cThe budget I just introduced has that kind of \ncontinuity in mind. We want the Galliker Dairies of Pennsylvania to be here for our \nchildren and beyond.\u201d \n \nLearn more about Gov.
