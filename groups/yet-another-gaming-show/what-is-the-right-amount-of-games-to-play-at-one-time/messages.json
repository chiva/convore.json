With hearing that Mass Effect 3 was going to be ever more shooter and less rpg, it makes me scared to see what will become of DA3.\n\nJeff brought up a good point, that there are other platforms to play on as well. I tend to get very \"tunnel vision-y\" and only play one game, so I have been playing more games on my phone and DSi. And after hearing Evan & Ashley talk about Portal 2 I am going to have to buy that (even though I sucked at the first one).", "group_id": 1948, "id": 1085920}]
