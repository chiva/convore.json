We are spending the first two nights and the last two nights of our holiday in London.  We prefer to be centrally located so that we can walk to most anywhere. We have been there many times before so we won't be spending much time at the major attractions, but we still enjoy seeing them.  Do you have any recommendations of things to see other than the usual (Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Parliment/Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, etc)", "group_id": 4497, "id": 884258}]
