If you wanted to implement for example keyword arguments, or rename \"acons\" to \"cons?\", or put the compiler in a separate namespace, then ideally ar would already support whatever you wanted to do: you could simply set an option or write a library to implement your feature.\n\nBut of course often ar won't be hackable enough yet.  We'll need to improve ar to support whatever it is that you want to do.\n\nFor discussion, here are my suggested steps.\n\nFirst, make a branch of ar and implement your feature in whatever is the easiest, most straightforward way to get your feature to work.  You don't have to worry at this step about backwards compatibility or breaking everything else.  Just get your feature to work.\n\nNext, write some tests that demonstrate that your feature is working the way you want it to.  (Or, if existing tests already provide enough coverage, maybe you can just fix the existing tests so that they work with your new feature).  This is important for other developers, because it means they can work on ar and know if they're breaking your feature or not.\n\nNow, at this point we have something we can look at to figure out how to integrate it into ar. Make a pull request on github, or post a message with the URL to your branch.", "group_id": 9739, "id": 996472}]
