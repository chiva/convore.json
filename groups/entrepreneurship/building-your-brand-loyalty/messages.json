How would you expect your customer to stick with your brand, if you won't?\n\nBest example, let's take American automobile companies. Prior to the recession, Chrysler, GM and Chevy were announcing new models off their assembly line left, right and center: HHR, 300, PT Cruiser, Charger, Magnum, Durango, Denali, Suburban, Yukon, Cobalt, etc. Only to have them discontinued a few years later. \n\nNow look at Japanese automobile companies. Companies like Honda and Toyota build brands for vehicles they build on, improve on and work with. The initial product answered a certain need (fuel economy, sport, luxury) but they work with it. Take the Honda Civic - its on its way to its ninth revision and one of the best selling cars in its class. Sure it may be a reliable car, fuel efficient, but its not that much cheaper than other cars in its class. They've worked with it and matured it with their customers, in turn building loyalty for most.\n\nI'm glad to say I feel American automobile companies are taking a page out of this book. I am a big fan of domestics, and hope they do well. Ford, for example, is working with the Focus and Fusion brands, lets hope they work with their brands before quickly writing them off.", "group_id": 250, "id": 206316}]
