We're an awesome duo: he's a really gifted designer, and I'm a touched in the head developer. We're playing around with different platforms and product ideas, just generally trying to find something that people want to pay us for. :)\n\nTo that end, we're offering our services to help bootstrap our business. We can do iPhone, Android and web design and development. Our rates are very reasonable, but it really does depend on the scope of the project. \n\nIf we can help anyone out, we'd love to hear from you. I can be reached very easily via chtzr@bouncr.com.
