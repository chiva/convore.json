You should treat this like you would a vc meeting, e.g. know your business model, your market and your competition, have already set up a landing page with email sign up and social engagement (no programming required for this). Basically, create an MVP and validate your idea even before you approach a developer. If you can do that you are above 99% of everyone else and you will be welcomed. Have a roadmap prepared and clearly define the next steps in terms of MVPs, e.g what is the first deliverable that you and your co-founder need to build. That's often something that can be done in 2 or 3 weeks, so the risk is manageable.  Also, think about this as a partnership (there are tons of quora posts on the subject), don't be greedy, and be honest with yourself and your potential co-founder about what you bring onto the table. Also fire fast. If something does not smell right, you got a bad feeling then go separate ways. Be upfront about expectations. It is really important that your goals are aligned. If you want a vc funded company and your partner wants a lifestyle business then it is not going to work.
