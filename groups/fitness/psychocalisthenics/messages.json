It seems similar to power yoga or ashtanga, from reading about it. I will check it out. In the cold weather months I use plyometrics and my precor elliptical. I also bought the Airope from Power Systems (www.powersystems.com) so I can jump rope indoors! The upper body workout is actually a little better than my speed rope, but nothing is better than taking it outdoors. It looks like maybe Psychocalisthenics could be done outdoors when it's warmer?", "group_id": 105, "id": 149650}, {"user_id": 11619, "stars": [], "topic_id": 6182, "date_created": 1298816187.014158, "message": "Yes, Psychocalisthenics can also be done outdoors in decent weather.
