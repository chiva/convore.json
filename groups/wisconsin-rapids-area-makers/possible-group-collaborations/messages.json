Most I've seen are brute force gizmos. I have an idea for one that I believe would be a record setter. And I have talked to the Pres of the Punkin Chunkin Association about it because it doesn't fit into any of the current categories. He said if I was serious, he could work on getting a new category added to the rules. Probably would be a demonstration unit until someone else joined the category. But having some contacts at MIT I thought I could throw down the gauntlet and challenge the east coasters to join in.
