He says he saw an article on Ars Technica about a security researcher who used five TOR exit nodes to collect logon passwords from unencrypted traffic.  What's the deal?  I thought TOR was safe.  I'm going to add something to this because we've now heard reports of at least one, I think two TOR administrators, one TOR administrator in Germany who was subpoenaed by the German authorities, they took his machine and all the information on that machine.  Of course the authorities had no clue what to do with it.  In fact it was worthless to them.  But it does raise the issue of people can get these individual machines.  Does that compromise TOR?\n\nSTEVE:  Well, and in fact the guy you're talking about in Germany, this was the second time he had been harassed by the government.  And he said, I'm sorry, but I'm no longer going to be able to host an endpoint node on the TOR system because of the problems that it creates.\n\nLEO:  And by the way, the German police got nothing from this.  They're at the wrong point.\n\nSTEVE:  Well, so, okay.  So let's explain what's going on here.  First of all, this rather irresponsible security researcher, I mean, it's www.derangedsecurity.com.  I consider him a little irresponsible, maybe a lot irresponsible...\n\nLEO:  That should tell you something, just the name.\n\nSTEVE:  Yeah, DEranged Security, because he was running - he runs a bunch of TOR nodes.  And he specifically wrote a packet sniffer to find high-value email logon credentials, that is, username and passwords for, for example, governments and embassies and other high-value targets.  He put these sniffers on five TOR servers, and they collected thousands of email name/logon password combinations.  Then, because he didn't feel that anyone would take this seriously unless a lot of noise was made, he published these things that he had gathered publicly on the basis that, first, nobody would pay attention to this problem otherwise; and that, well, these were all in the clear anyway, traveling around the Internet, so what's the big deal?\n\nWell, the big deal was the U.S. government immediately stomped on him and had his site taken down.  All kinds of people were really upset.  And essentially he published the email logons for a bunch of embassy, government embassy email accounts, and a whole bunch of problems resulted, as you can imagine.  So...\n\nLEO:  But underlying that, did he point up a security issue?\n\nSTEVE:  No.  What he did was - and this is valuable.  The reason I wanted to put this question up, first of all, a lot of people picked up on it and wrote to us about this, so I wanted to address it directly.  What TOR does is it anonymizes users of the Internet.  It does not provide end-to-end security, meaning that, for example, SSL, Secure Sockets Layer we've talked about often, it provides end-to-end security, meaning that when I use - when a GRC customer buying SpinRite wants to buy SpinRite, the first thing that happens is an SSL connection is created, securing all of their traffic from their machine to the GRC server and back.  So nothing can be seen.  TOR doesn't provide encryption except between TOR server nodes.  But on the final node, after your traffic is bounced around between TOR servers, where it is encrypted, and the TOR protocol makes it extremely hard to backtrack, once it finally is done bouncing around, playing ping-pong around TOR nodes, the final TOR node decrypts it the last time, essentially takes it out of the final encryption envelope, peels that layer off the onion, so to speak, and the traffic is then emitted or injected onto the Internet in the clear, that is, as plaintext.\n\nSo the mistake that these embassy people were making is they may have believed that all of their traffic was encrypted by using this system, when in fact all that was being done was they were being anonymized, meaning that potentially they could not be backtracked.  On the other hand, their email had their client IP and server name, and everyone knew, anyone who looked at this would know where they were logging onto and what was going on.  And all their email even was in the clear apparently, the actual content of their email.  So...\n\nLEO:  So he just pointed out how insecure their system was, really.\n\nSTEVE:  Well, he pointed out that people were using TOR for the wrong reason.  They were - and that...\n\nLEO:  Yeah.  They were assuming they were secure.\n\nSTEVE:  They were assuming, exactly, that it was providing them absolutely security on the \u2018Net, when in fact all it was really doing, all it was meant to do is to provide anonymity services.  Now, the reason the guy in Germany has gotten into trouble several times is that it was for child pornography that he was arrested.  What happened was that government officials were tracking back the IP of somebody who apparently was pulling child pornography off of a child pornography site.  Well, this child pornography viewing end user was using the TOR system to provide him or her with anonymity for this web surfing that they were doing.  And what happened was the child porn IP was terminating on this TOR endpoint, where it then became encrypted and was then anonymized.\n\nSo somebody on the outside of the TOR system saw that this node was apparently making these child porn queries, when in fact they were being made on behalf of somebody using the TOR system for anonymity.  And you can't blame them in this case for wanting to be anonymous.  I mean, they understood clearly that this is what TOR was used for.  So the authorities went to this endpoint and arrested this guy, unfortunately.  He did nothing wrong except he was running a TOR node endpoint.  And this in fact is the great danger of running TOR node endpoints.  It's actually there's a double-edged sword here.  If you run the endpoint, then people on the \u2018Net will believe that it's your machine which is making these queries of potentially bad stuff, when in fact your machine is making them on behalf of somebody who wants to be anonymous specifically because they want to do things which are in many cases and many countries and locations illegal to do.\n\nThe other side of this is that all of the traffic which is coming and going from that endpoint can be scrutinized by anyone running the endpoint.  And in fact something that is useful is that this DEranged Security guy has a list of example exit nodes that can read your traffic.  And so he says nodes named devilhacker and hackershaven; node hosted by an illegal hacker group; major nodes hosted anonymously dedicated to TOR by the same person or organization in Washington, D.C. - each of these are handling five to ten terabytes of data every month; a node hosted by Space Research Institute/Cosmonauts Training Center controlled by the Russian government.\n\nLEO:  Wow.  The Russian government runs a TOR node.\n\nSTEVE:  Yeah.  Nodes hosted on several government controlled academies in the U.S., Russia, and around Asia; nodes hosted by criminal identity stealers; nodes hosted by Ministry of Education in Taiwan, you know, run by China; node hosted by major stock exchange company and Fortune 500 financial company; nodes hosted anonymously on dedicated servers for TOR, costing the owner between $100 and $500 every month, meaning presumably they're getting some value in return; nodes hosted by the Chinese government officials; nodes in over 50 countries with unknown owners; and nodes handling over 10 terabytes of data every month. So the point is that, you know...\n\nLEO:  10 terabytes.\n\nSTEVE:  Yeah.  People are using TOR to do things anonymously.  But you're using - when the traffic egresses from the TOR network, you don't know who owns the node that it's egressing from, nor do you know what purpose they're using the node for.  So it's worth mentioning that, once your data egresses the TOR system, it is no longer encrypted.  It has been anonymized as the TOR system provides.  But depending upon what you're doing, you may still be giving your identity away.  And people of unknown ambition and goal could be looking at it.\n\nLEO:  I think that's the bottom line, the really most important takeaway from this is that TOR is for anonymity, not encryption.", "group_id": 3864, "id": 638143}, {"user_id": 11411, "stars": [], "topic_id": 18811, "date_created": 1302585672.9849391, "message": "Hopefully, the IP anonymity is fairly safe (though I guess there's vulnerabilities) so the only way they'll associate you with the machine is if you did something that's \"you\" inside the machine.
