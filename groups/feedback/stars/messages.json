Maybe it's funny, maybe it's insightful, or maybe it's just useful information, but whatever the reason, a star lets you know it's good.\n\nUmm, that's like a Thumbs Up, an up vote, +rep, or +karma, or something. A star, as seen in Firefox, Chrome, Gmail, and many other places, is usually a way to bookmark or favorite things. You can't find your starred messages anywhere (that I'm aware of).\n\nIt's stupidly inconsistent with other software.
