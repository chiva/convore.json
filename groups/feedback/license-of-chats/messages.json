For example I started a public group http://convore.com/photo and I'm the only one who has posted there. It's a public group! Are there not any photographers that want to chat? I also created \"photos\" with the same result. A public group with a generic name like that should generate some topics. By the way convore should consider a rule whereby generic names for groups must be used for public groups. Otherwise someone could grab a good name like \"Movies\" and put a private group there thus locking away the name.", "group_id": 88, "id": 506346}]
