SO, everything goes well, because the slug for the group was \"users-1\" ans was able to access it through: https://convore.com/users-1/ (pretty neat. How do you achieve that without a /groups/ before and allowing flatpages fallback?). The trouble comes when i edited the group in https://convore.com/users-1/edit/ and change the group URL to: https://convore.com/users/ of course, for the sake of testing ;). So, right now, my private group is holding this URL - which may be wrong - and i'm not able to edit the group url. https://convore.com/users/edit/ give me back a 404 page.
