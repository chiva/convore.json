The first was a broken-down bus in China; I wanted to see if anyone had any water I could buy while we waited for repairs. The second was a queue for a cruise ship that was delayed for hours while they disinfected everything due to some disease outbreak - I wanted to buy food. The third was an airport I was stuck in overnight. At the airport, a guy noticed we'd both been on our laptops all night and approached me suggesting we play chess. That was very outgoing of him, but for every person that actually suggests that to a stranger, there are probably a dozen who consider it but talk themselves out of it. I've been thinking that there ought to be a website or mobile app that creates impromptu localized groups for these kinds of needs. Convore is really close, and in fact could already work so long as someone yells out (at, for example, stranded bus passengers) \"hey our Convore group is broken_bus_2011_02_10, so if you want to buy or sell something or play a game or socialize or anything, start a conversation there\". GPS or geolocation could help this. You might even want to push a notification to a user's phone like \"a geolocated group named broken_bus_2011_02_10 has just started within 200 feet of your location. You are invited to join.\"", "group_id": 88, "id": 64512}]
