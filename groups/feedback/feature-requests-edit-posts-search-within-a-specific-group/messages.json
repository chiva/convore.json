That said, it would be nice to be able to edit a post, instead of deleting and re-creating it, in the event I make any errors. The other request I have is to allow for searching within a Group alone. AFAIK, the current search spans all Groups. It would be great if I could specify the particular group I want to search on. Other than that, I must say, Convore is definitely growing on me :)", "group_id": 88, "id": 763484}, {"user_id": 4149, "stars": [], "topic_id": 20624, "date_created": 1303354937.546726, "message": "If they give you like 10mins or something buffered time", "group_id": 88, "id": 765002}, {"user_id": 9108, "stars": [], "topic_id": 20624, "date_created": 1303381916.355648, "message": "I agree that this might be handy if it happened within some type of relatively low timeframe before you were no longer able to edit it.
