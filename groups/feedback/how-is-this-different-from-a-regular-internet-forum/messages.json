They need to add a few more features like photo / video uploading from the browser and iPhone app but convore is on its way to something really great. I really like the group name being the URL. For example my convore page is http://convore.com/craig so this makes it easy for me to share this group. Even a topic has a URL so I can share a topic if I wish e.g. https://convore.com/feedback/how-is-this-different-from-a-regular-internet-forum/\n\nAll this makes convore more than just a chat room or forum. The key to convore's success IMO is uptake.
