However, when I logged in the site was displaying the attached graphic which is one I use for some sites. I just wonder where it got it from? It's the one I use for Twitter but I didn't use my Twitter account to sign in and although my user name is the same the site can't know that I'm the same person - or can it?", "group_id": 88, "id": 321904}, {"user_id": 16271, "stars": [], "topic_id": 12312, "date_created": 1299891579.8474209, "message": "@laughingchance not really bad etiquette here to send a few replies to a topic.
