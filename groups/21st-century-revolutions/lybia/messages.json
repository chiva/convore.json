I have been reading that the Libyans are losing, I have a ton of guerrilla manuals and fighting guides for the people. I was trying to figure out how to contact some of the guerrillas/rebels there. We should start putting as much info as possible for them to make their own revolution, maybe get in contact with some of them. That would be the best solution. Good video btw, I luvs RT, Al Jazeera and most shows on Free Speech TV. But I think supporting them intellectually will be the best. They have a small window to make this thing work. I think we should support them as much as possible, not as in our governments but as individuals.", "group_id": 4963, "id": 300511}]
