Nevertheless, dietary fat composition yields significantly different effects on lipoprotein levels and on cardiovascular events. Diets high in saturated fat fail to decrease total cholesterol, even with significant weight loss. Both saturated and unsaturated fat increase HDL cholesterol levels. However, in clinical tudies, increased saturated fat consumption is still associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. In contrast, substituting unsaturated fats for saturated fats yields the combined benefit of lowering total serum cholesterol levels and raising serum HDL cholesterol. This effect, together with favorable effects on markers of insulin resistance and inflammation, and potential antiarrhythmic effects of marine-based n-3 fatty acids, may partly explain why unsaturated fat consumption is associated with reduced cardiovascular events. Current guidelines from the NCEP now recommend increased proportions of unsaturated fat (25% to 35% total fat with less than 7% from saturated fat) [2]. However, a remaining question for future investigation is whether there is any beneficial effect of diets containing even higher proportions of unsaturated fat (eg, > 35% total fat with < 7% saturated fat).\"\n\n2.

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 2011;93(4):684-688.\n\n\"ABSTRACT\nCurrent dietary recommendations advise reducing the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, but recent \ufb01ndings question the role of SFAs. This expert panel reviewed the evidence and reached the following conclusions: the evidence from epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic studies is consistent in \ufb01nding that the risk of CHD is reduced when SFAs are replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In populations who consume a Western diet, the replacement of 1% of energy from SFAs with PUFAs lowers LDL cholesterol and is likely to produce a reduction in CHD incidence of \u00152\u20133%. No clear bene\ufb01t of substituting carbohydrates for SFAs has been shown, although there might be a bene\ufb01t if the carbohydrate is unre\ufb01ned and has a low glycemic index. Insuf\ufb01cient evidence exists to judge the effect on CHD risk of replacing SFAs with MUFAs. No clear association between SFA intake relative to re\ufb01ned carbohydrates and the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes has been shown. The effect of diet on a single biomarker is insuf\ufb01cient evidence to assess CHD risk. The combination of multiple biomarkers and the use of clinical endpoints could help substantiate the effects on CHD. Furthermore, the effect of particular foods on CHD cannot be predicted solely by their content of total SFAs because individual SFAs may have different cardiovascular effects and major SFA food sources contain other constituents that could in\ufb02uence CHD risk. Research is needed to clarify the role of SFAs compared with speci\ufb01c forms of carbohydrates in CHD risk and to compare speci\ufb01c foods with appropriate alternatives.
