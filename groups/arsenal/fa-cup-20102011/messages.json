I do honestly feel really good for them. The Olympic Stadium mess threatens their future, and this might go a little way to helping. One more game is a small price for Arsenal to pay to help a neighbor. And I'm not worried about fixture congestion because it's this same lot who will be playing the replay, and not the first team. If anything I expect Ebou\u00e9 to come in for Sagna and Diaby (if healthy) for Song.  Besides Squillaci, Denilson, Rosicky & Almunia who've had a miserable season, the rest have been able stand-ins for injured/suspended first-teamers and the group as a whole just needs to play themselves into form that befits their talent.
