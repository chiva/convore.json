Inspired by Dante and Virgil, I had Tim guide a hapless freshman (\"Mike\", a character who had been cropping up in my fiction for several years) through Santa Cruz. Tim, though, was an anti-Virgil, a paragon of unreason and absurdity; a guide to nowhere and nothing.", "group_id": 89, "id": 39770}, {"user_id": 224, "stars": [], "topic_id": 1511, "date_created": 1296493430.728992, "message": "Notes For a Future Novel was the main focus of my work as a writer for the next year and a half. I wrote a tremendous amount in the next year and a half. The total number of words I produced from March \u201991 to May \u201993 was more than 152,000. To put that into perspective, that works out to about a five-hundred page novel. It works out to about 382 words per day, though there were some periods when I greatly exceeded that rate. July 1992, when I was living at my father\u2019s house on Hamilton Ave. in Palo Alto was a particularly fruitful period, as I churned out almost 21,000 words in three weeks. That era was the first time, I believe, that I demonstrated the kind of discipline, productivity and stamina that one would need to be a novelist.  \nThe version of Notes For a Future Novel I have chosen for this collection is based on the third draft, which was originally released in May 1993, just before I left on a six-week cross-country driving trip. It was my custom in those days to create periodic releases of Notes For a Future Novel, bound at Kinko\u2019s, which I would distribute to friends and family in order to get their feedback, and perhaps reassure them that my apparent aimlessness was in fact merely a smokescreen for a budding genius at work. My friends were somewhat bemused, and seemed to regard it as mainly an opportunity to look back nostalgically at our time in Santa Cruz, since their memories were hazier than mine (I won\u2019t speculate as to why.) \nDraft III represented a major reduction in scope of the work. Huge amounts of writing were excised from the drafts of the previous year, which included many of the intra-textual elements, such as the novel/film \u201cCrazy For Love.\u201d I made these changes based on feedback I had received from trusted friends, perhaps best expressed by one who wrote me, \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re writing this novel specifically to prove how well-read you are to your old college professors.\u201d Ouch! But so true\u2026\nIn looking at Notes For a Future Novel as the source of the characters and some of the situations in the Santa Zita Novels, the title is quite apt, but in recent re-readings I have, with the perspective of the years, come to see it as a cohesive work that is worth reading in its own right. I don\u2019t worry too much about the fact that the same characters and much of the same plot re re-used in The Deep & Savage Way, or the inconsistencies between the worlds of Santa Cruz and Santa Zita\u2014in a way, along with my Santa Cruz experiences in reality, I regard them as projections on a cave wall of some Platonic ideal of the city on the hill over-looking the city by the sea.",
