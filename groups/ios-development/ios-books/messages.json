I'm new to programming and Kochan's books was great at teaching Obj-C without prior knowledge of C, which was a problem for me with a few books. I read the apple docs on Object Oriented Programming with Obj-C prior to these, and the basic understanding I had of Actionscript helped me with the concepts a bunch.
