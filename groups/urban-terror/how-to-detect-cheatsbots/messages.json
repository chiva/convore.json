Well, as you did in my case. It is easy to detect an aim bot if you are accustomed to the game. In case of an aim bot, the player you are spectating, will have very high number of kills and very less number of deaths. Some players are professionals, they are experts in killing, so be careful before accusing anyone and spec thoroughly  . The cross hair of an aim botter automatically shifts to an opponent and remains there until he kills him/her or another opponent arrives. It is impossible to move your cross hair that quickly and keep it on an opponent with precision. So, it is  easy to detect.", "group_id": 9089, "id": 752198}, {"user_id": 30380, "stars": [], "topic_id": 20384, "date_created": 1303277207.391268, "message": "On to wall hacks. Wall hacks can be tricky and can take a while to detect. It also needs spectating a player who you think is cheating. A wall hack in urban terror is a cheat which shows you the position of each and every player,opponents or team mates, with colour of uniform,  irrespective of walls and other objects. The players who are farthest appear smallest and the players who are closest appear normal size. Now, a wall hacking player knows the position and movement of the opponents, so they normally go in the direction opposite to that of the player or hide just before an opponent is coming out of a building so they can kill. It takes a lot of time to detect an expert wall hacker but eventually you will catch him with his movements and wall hacking habits. Almost all wall hackers have the same habits. You can also take demos of the players who cheat and upload them to the server admins who will take appropriate action.", "group_id": 9089, "id": 752278}]
