It takes approximately 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup. The amount of sap exactly required to make one gallon of syrup is related to the sweetness. The sweeter the sap the less it takes to make one gallon of maple syrup. Jones rule of 86 says that: If you divide the sap sweetness into 86 you get the exact number of gallons to make 1 gallon of syrup. Thus, it will take 86 gallons of sap with 1% sweetness to make a gallon of syrup and only 17 gallons of sap at 5% sweetness. Our sap today was 2.1% so it would produce about 2.2 gallons.
