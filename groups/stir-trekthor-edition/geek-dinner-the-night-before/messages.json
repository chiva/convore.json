We've met at the food court at Polaris, where there are plenty of food options and room to spread out to talk and to possibly play games.  (Zombie Fluxx has made an appearance in the past.)  Is there interest in putting together one of these for this year's event?", "group_id": 6477, "id": 333286}, {"user_id": 22693, "stars": [], "topic_id": 12609, "date_created": 1300464296.76998, "message": "Sounds like a good idea to me.  The food court is great because everyone can find something they like to eat, and there's plenty of seating.  I could bring Munchkin!", "group_id": 6477, "id": 383118}]
