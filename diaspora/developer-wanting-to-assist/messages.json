Diaspora caught my eye a long time ago, and after checking in, thought that it might be fun (now that I have the time) to help out.  \n\nMy strengths are in UI development, UI animations, and can do a bit of graphic design.  I would love to get into the back end too.  I've previously worked on a start-up themed social network in PHP and have done open source work with projects like WolfCMS, jQuery, and Wordpress.  \n\nIs there any particular thing I can help with--any area that's hurting in particular?  Thanks much!", "group_id": 8694, "id": 2114819}, {"user_id": 43860, "stars": [], "topic_id": 45212, "date_created": 1322320853.0403531, "message": "Hi, I'm a web developer for 5 years now and I'm willing to help to reach the top :) I'm experienced in Javascript, Ajax, HTML5, CSS2 and CSS3, prototype library and knowledgeable with jquery.
