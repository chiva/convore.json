Nevertheless, it appears to be true that the older seniors, whose life style didn't include the use of computers, are being left behind.  \"Seniors On Net\" is a voluntary organization which seeks to encourage that group to get involved.  Skype is the preferred communications tool, and we have looked for an alternative to FB and Twitter for background correspondence.  Diaspora may have something to offer, and we are certainly interested to see whether Convore develops for a geberal audience, or attracts only the younger citizens.", "group_id": 8694, "id": 2578758}]
