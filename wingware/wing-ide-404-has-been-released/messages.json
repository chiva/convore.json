I have a question about the new feature \"Commands to copy editor and project file names to clipboard\".  This sounds great, since I've been dying for the ability to get full file names to the clipboard (like in Visual Studio or Notepad++).  Unfortunately, the menu items (both in the \"Edit\" menu and the project-context-menu) are always disabled.  I'm on Windows 7.  I don't see any documentation on this feature, either.", "group_id": 6885, "id": 2285494}, {"user_id": 21093, "stars": [], "topic_id": 45611, "date_created": 1317913913.882947, "message": "Sorry we screwed that up due to a last minute change in the command name...
