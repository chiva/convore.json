In order to do this properly, I need to know if the user has an associated Twitter or Facebook account and the ID of that UserSocialAuth object. Since I can't add a custom function to the User object to encapsulate asking for linked accounts and IDs, I added it to the UserInfo class I'm using to extend the built-in to User model. Sometimes when creating a new account by logging in with Twitter or Facebook, it seems the UserInfo object is never created when the User model is. This makes in impossible to ask the UserInfo object about the UserSocialAuth objects. Any ideas on how to do this better? My current solution is just doing it all in the views, but I may end up repeating myself that way.", "group_id": 5196, "id": 1985809}, {"user_id": 20656, "stars": [], "topic_id": 44581, "date_created": 1314804624.114974, "message": "You should define a signal handler for socialauth_registered signal (check http://django-social-auth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/signals.html), that handler should create the UserInfo instance that you mention.", "group_id": 5196, "id": 2011869}]
