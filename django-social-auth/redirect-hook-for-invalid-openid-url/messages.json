I've seen this happen with some of my users where they incorrectly type their openid url and know that a good error message would be helpful.  Instead I'm stuck with a generic 500 error page.  More generally when social_auth raises ValueErrors I feel it should always redirect to the LOGIN_ERROR_URL.", "group_id": 5196, "id": 1735754}]
