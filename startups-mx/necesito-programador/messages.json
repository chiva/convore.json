It is not very serious people I have found, so I would like some recommendations where I can find the really hardworking and clever programmers.\n\nSkills: PHP, markup HTML/CSS, Javascript (jQuery), MySQL, some understanding of OO, maybe experience in Flex.\n\nI will educate this person to do the standards needed for the european clients I have (as I have seen quite a lot of horrible programming here in mex unfortunately :( ).\n\nI hope you can give me some advice from this great forum.
