Sometimes I feel like watching reality tv or those lame competition shows but I don't because it's only a product of what culture/society is telling me is popular. Same goes for clothing and political/religious leanings. I don't put myself in a strict category for fear of being grouped with others who misrepresent why I believe; on the other hand, titles and categories are necessary for comparison and discussions of those comparisons. Modern \"culture\" is what nonimportant, irrelevant yet influential people tell us what we should like, do, or think.", "group_id": 10825, "id": 1581650}]
