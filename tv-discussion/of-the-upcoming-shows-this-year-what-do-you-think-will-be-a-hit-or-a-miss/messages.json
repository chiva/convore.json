Fox will do well with Terra Nova and Alcatraz. Will like to see Touch (FOX) and Awake (NBC) kind of vie for their fans. NBC has gone crazy and added a couple of other new shows but I doubt most will make it past S01. Same for ABC, they are too ban happy. Don't know of any new CBS shows (after The Unit, they kinda seemed irrelevant. Though I still watch Rules of Engagement, Blue Bloods, and Craig Ferguson).", "group_id": 11, "id": 1565425}]
