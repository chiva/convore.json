The Packers (which I prefer, I guess) really held it together and were just constantly performing above and beyond. And, they survived injury after injury. Good game. I think. I don't really know much about football. HOWEVER - I do know how to throw a party. Last night's UA party was... beyond epic. To the point where I didn't think I would survive this morning. The hangover was just absurd, just completely absurd. So, I wake up, still mostly drunk, and remember that the night before my friends convinced me to throw a superbowl party. There are assholes. I've never even watched the superbowl, much less thrown a party. So, I read up on how TV works (apparently it's like magnets, via magic) and go to Radio Shack to buy an antenna, and then to the store to buy a literal ton of food. Many SMS's were exchanged, trying to figure out what superbowl food involves. Apparently it's mostly cheese-based. However, since it's Portland, and I'm me, I got a ton of meat and bacon to combine in delicious ways. That turned out well. Anyway, that, on top of a fuckton of alcohol to stave off the hangover, turned today into a very pleasant experience. The worst part was the truly awful sound engineering at the half-time show, which prompted my girlfriend to say, \"She sounds like you at karaoke!\" Sigh.
