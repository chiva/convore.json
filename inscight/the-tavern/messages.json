It might even be easier, with all the commercial kits and tech support + free training seminars from manufacturers, robotic platforms, etc... The bottleneck is data analysis, not data generation. I applaud the initiative to provide a platform to share technical videos --especially in a peer-reviewed way that gives value (in citation metrics) to those who take the time and effort to produce them, but I agree with @spidr that the costs seems unreasonable.
