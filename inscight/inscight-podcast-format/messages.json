Intro music, chosen by one of the panelists this week\n2. Introductions: Moderator says a little (self-prepared) blurb about each\n   panelist on this week.\n3. Field Listener Questions / Comments.\n4. Topics:\n\n    * There will be 1 - 3 topics per episode.\n    * The moderator segues into each topic and lets panelists know when it is\n      their turn initially.\n    * Each person gets 1.5 min to speak in the first round.\n    * Second and further rounds are limited to a minute.\n    * Time may be yielded, etc\n    * Timing and order are soft limits\n\n5. Rants/Soapbox: 20 - 30s per person.  May be about anything.\n6. Outro music.\n\n\nEpisode Prep (Important!)\n-------------------------\n1. Check and see if you are slated to speak next week\n2. Edit topics:\n\n    * Add sub-topics you want to speak about\n    * Give a rough outline of your main points\n    * Make sure you bring something new / different / debatable to the discussion\n\n3. Come excited and chatty\n\n\nEpisode Types\n-------------\n1. Deep cut discussions on a single subject.  Starting from a high level, these\n   discussions won't shy away from digging into the theoretical details.\n2. Invited guest episodes.  These are similar to interviews where an invited guest\n   is allowed a certain amount of time (~5 min) at the beginning to talk about\n   their research / project.  Then the remaining panelists jump in and the regular\n   episode flow continues.\n3. Topical / Conference episodes.  These will be an overview (prior or post) of a\n   conference.  As such they\\u2019ll cover a range of topics quickly, while hitting\n   the major themes.  Additionally, current event news would fit in this category.\n\n\nAudience\n--------\nWe have yet to figure out who our target audience is.  However, here is how we should \ncommunicate with them:\n\n    1. Blog / Wave\n    2. Twitter\n    3. Lists\n    4. IRC\n    5. Github", "group_id": 3435, "id": 105006}]
