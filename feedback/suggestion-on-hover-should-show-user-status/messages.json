Second suggestion: it would be nice to be able to hover over the name of someone who posted in a topic and see a little popup with perhaps their bio info but at least if they are online.  Or I guess it could be done with some kind of an icon next to their name that indicates online status.  I recognize that their name will show up in the list of members online but since the pictures are kind of small and I can't figure out how it's sorted, it's not immediately obvious if the member is online or not without clicking through to their profile and then going back to the topic.  I think best thing would be to have the bio with online/offline status popup on hover.", "group_id": 88, "id": 223731}, {"user_id": 16271, "stars": [], "topic_id": 9471, "date_created": 1298938475.0499351, "message": "I also just noticed that people who star are not hyperlinked at all.
