We require that consumers of streams respect those deletions: That is, if you delete a tweet on Twitter it should disappear from Google's realtime search index as well, and will disappear from timelines in clients too.\n\nThere's a limited amount that's technical possible, but our intent is that where you see Tweets in the context of Twitter (twitter.com, a Twitter client, or a direct feed of Twitter content, such as in Google) then what you see should represent what's actually on Twitter, and so deletions propagate where possible.\n\nBut, at their simplest, tweets are just like any other kind written word and speech, and so they can and will be legitimately quoted.", "group_id": 88, "id": 513480}, {"user_id": 12304, "stars": [{"date_created": 1301826037.311244, "user_id": 96}], "topic_id": 16536, "date_created": 1301822921.360383, "message": "@BenWard, thanks for that.

I don't care that much about gaining new registered users of our app - I care more about the content - but OAuth allows us to know that one of our stored Tweets has been faved/replied/retweeted so we can add this information.
