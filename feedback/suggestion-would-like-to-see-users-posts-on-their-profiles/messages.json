Clearly this would have to be filtered by groups that I am a member of or are public to avoid data spills from private groups.  Specific use case - was looking at a conversation in the API group and I was curious what the member was actually developing.  Went to their profile to see if I could see an earlier post where they stated but realized that functionality is not there.  Note - listing ALL posts may be too heavy - might be better just to list topics they have contributed to.", "group_id": 88, "id": 242787}]
