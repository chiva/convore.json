We have a chicken and egg here without users the groups are worthless and we need things like embedding to get users. IMO convore will be in an excellent position to make some $$ when they have millions of users and are growing at a rapid rate. Then they can go to advertisers and offer super targeted advertising at high rates. Imagine going to Nikon and offering them banner ads in the \"Camera\" group when such a group gets thousands of postings a day and has 20,000 active members. Now that's valuable. The $$ is in the large public groups. The BIG question is can convore survive long enough to reach critical mass. Sure, there can also be a pro version without the ads.
