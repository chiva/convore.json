The number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.[1] This trend has continued for more than half a century and is expected to continue until 2015 or 2020 or later. \n\nSo, what does this mean to businesses? Simply put: Technology and especially the Internet needs to be take seriously. If you don't your competition will and given this exponential growth in the capabilities of technology to help a business those that choose to embrace and learn to leverage the Internet will have the advantage. \n\nThe good news is if you work with our experts we can actually show your team how to make the complicated seem easy. Work smarter not harder.\n\nSo, the take away message here is act now and as Moore's Law marches forward your business will be along for the exciting ride to come. - http://CraigShipp.com\ufffc", "group_id": 5971, "id": 1205799}, {"user_id": 18485, "stars": [], "topic_id": 33868, "date_created": 1307488521.94787, "message": "download here: https://sites.google.com/a/frederick.com/example-site-/site-features/File-Cabinet-Sample/timeline.mp3", "group_id": 5971, "id": 1330403}, {"user_id": 18485, "stars": [], "topic_id": 33868, "date_created": 1307488492.0341129, "message": "timeline intro (worth listening) http://audioboo.fm/boos/46704-timeline", "group_id": 5971, "id": 1330398}, {"user_id": 18485, "stars": [], "topic_id": 33868, "date_created": 1317176163.082983, "message": "Interesting article on the history of the CPU: http://www.maclife.com/article/columns/lifer_how_far_cpus_have_come_and_where_they%E2%80%99re_going", "group_id": 5971, "id": 2229420}]
