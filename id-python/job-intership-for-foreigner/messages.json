Since my transition to informatics is recent, strong learning abilities and rough experience in Python are beside theoretical knowledge currently the only skills I can offer. However, I believe to be able to gain whatever demanded competencies (OSs, DBMSs...) till the year-end.\n\nIf you know somebody who might want me, let me know, please.\n\nRegards,\n\nVojtech\n( vojtechpisl (at) hotmail.com )", "group_id": 3970, "id": 1802653}]
