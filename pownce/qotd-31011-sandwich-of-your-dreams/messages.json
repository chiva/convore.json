Hanging out in South Philly, eatin' a cheesesteak and just enjoying the scene..usually at 2AM when the bars close.  They're cheesesteaks are good, but there's plenty of much better cheesesteaks to be had.  I'm a fan of Jim's Steaks for a standard cheesesteak wit wiz (that's w/ fried onions and cheese wiz).  I like the mushroom and provolone variety as well.  Tony Luke's is good too but they've become too commercial.  Ishkabible's is known for their excellent chicken cheesesteaks and vegetarian cheesteaks.  One of the best (some consider them the benchmark) is Dalessandro's Steaks in the Roxborough section of Philly.  Their cheesesteaks are a truly amazing experience.\n\nEveryone in town has their preferred vendor.  But it all comes down to the bread, there are others but Amoroso's is the best.  That's one of the big reasons it's hard to get a really good cheesesteak outside of the Philly area...they don't have access to Amoroso's.  That and they don't seem to get the concept of thinly sliced beef. \n\nIf you want a really amazing sandwich (besides a cheesesteak), you have to try a Dinic's roast pork sandwich.  They're in the Reading Terminal Market.  Definitely a sandwich of your dreams.  The smell alone will drive you insane!
