We must DEMAND action from local health authorities. If these levels of radiation are being picked up in Canada it seems only a matter of time before they reach the west coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis should be a RED ALERT to all Americans and Canadians!\r\n\r\nKelowna BC receives High Fukushima Fallout Radioactive Rain on 07/16/11\r\n\r\nCRMT- Hope BC receives High Radioactive Fukushima Fallout Rain on 07/16/11\r\n\r\nHIGH Radiations levels found in Rain samples from Red Deer/Edmonton (1.02 mcSv/hr)\r\n\r\nhttp://theintelhub.com/2011/07/19/dangerous-levels-of-radiation-recorded-in-canada-as-fukushima-radiation-dangers-continue", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1686621}]
