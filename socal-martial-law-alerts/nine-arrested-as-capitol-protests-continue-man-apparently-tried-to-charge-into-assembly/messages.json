Scott Walker's proposal to strip most public employees of all collective bargaining rights, except for limited negotiations on salary. Walker has said the bill is necessary to close a budget shortfall of $137 million and a looming $3.6 billion deficit in the next two-year budget.\r\n\r\nThe arrests come after two days of incident-free rallies and demonstrations, as protesters have remained mostly peaceful. State officials did not immediately return calls asking for details on the nine arrests.\r\n\r\nPolice hand-cuffed one protester after he apparently tried to charge into the state Assembly.\r\n\r\nThousands of protesters have jammed the Capitol for days to complain about the bill.\r\n\r\nMoments before a roll call began in the Assembly on Thursday, reporters heard a crash outside the chamber. They rushed out and saw a man on the ground. Police officers were on top of him. They handcuffed him and led him away.\r\n\r\nA legislative aide said he saw the man rush from the line of protesters and try to charge into the chamber. The man tripped and the police captured him.\r\n\r\nOnly a handful of lawmakers were on the floor when the incident happened.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.channel3000.com/news/26902948/detail.html", "group_id": 3920, "id": 147593}]
