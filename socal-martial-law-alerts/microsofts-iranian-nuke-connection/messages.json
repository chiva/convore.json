Microsoft is based in the United States. Stuxnet hit computers running Windows 7 in Iran. Those computers were being used to help Iran make nuclear materials.\r\n\r\nJust sayin.\r\n\r\nIs it a secret way of infiltrating our enemies systems as some in the comments suggest this post is meant to say?Probably not.\r\n\r\nIs it an interesting anecdote about our globalized economy that shows one of the most famous U.S. companies\u2019 products is being used for a program the U.S. is dead-set on shutting down. Yes.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s especially interesting when all we hear about are the sanctions and other efforts being levied against Iran aimed at halting the country\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\r\n\r\nOf course we don\u2019t want to restrict the sale of Windows around the world. This is just one of those unavoidable occurances that makes you stop for a second in the midst of a serious story and say, \u201chow bout that.\u201d  And a blog, which this is, is a great forum to air such things.\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2010/12/08/microsofts-iranian-nuke-connection", "group_id": 3920, "id": 116728}]
