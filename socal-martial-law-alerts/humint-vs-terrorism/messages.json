It\u2019s about how many terror plots have been foiled by brainpower and good human intelligence work versus high tech gear.\r\n\r\n    \u201cIf you look at all the recent terrorist incidents, the bombs were detected because of human intelligence not because of screening \u2026 If even a fraction of what is spent on screening was invested in the intelligence services we would take a real step toward making air travel safer and more pleasant.\u201d\r\n\r\n     \u2013 Marijn Ornstein, chief of security, Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam\r\n\r\nOrnstein\u2019s comments bring to mind an earlier post we had here at DT.
