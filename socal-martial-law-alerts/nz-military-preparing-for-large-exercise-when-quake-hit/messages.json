NOT SURE WHY.\r\n\r\nBefore Its News\r\nby Zen Gardner\r\nFebruary 23rd, 2011\r\n\r\nWhy all these \u201ccoincidences\u201d involving natural disasters? Are they not \u201cnatural\u201d after all?\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the excerpt that caught my eye this morning. It may not be evidence of anything, yet it might. After all, the U.S. military had a huge operation \u201csimulating\u201d a tsunami scenario in Haiti in full swing at the time of the Haiti quake, and we also know the HAARP facility was pumping full blast at the time. No accidental \u201ccoincidence\u201d there.\r\n\r\n(From NZHerald.co.nz)\r\n\r\n    Defence Force\r\n\r\n    The Air Force has been helping to evacuate people from Christchurch.\r\n\r\n    A Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft evacuated people from Christchurch to Wellington this morning, and a second will follow, the Defence Force said.\r\n\r\n    It said staff had been preparing for a large exercise in the region and were now instead helping with the rescue effort.\r\n\r\nhttp://theintelhub.com/2011/02/23/nz-military-preparing-for-large-exercise-when-quake-hit/", "group_id": 3920, "id": 206497}]
