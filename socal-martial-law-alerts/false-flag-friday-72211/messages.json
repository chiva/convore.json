All major news outlets ran a report from a CIA analyst claiming a Muslim terrorist group took credit for the Oslo Norway bombings, which the corporate media is trying so desperately to blame on Al-Qaeda . Even though it would make no sense for Muslims to attack Norway, who is their ally. Regardless of the absurdity of the claim, the CIA has falsely stated that a Muslim Jihad group  has accepted responsibility for the attacks Norway bombings and now the corporate media is running their lies.\r\nhttp://blog.alexanderhiggins.com/2011/07/22/corporate-media-runs-false-cia-story-stating-muslim-group-claimed-responsibility-olso-bombings-40311\r\n\r\nOslo Police Conducted Bombing Exercise Days Before Terrorist Blast\r\nPrison Planet.com\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nIn yet another example of how almost every major terror event is accompanied by a security drill focused around the same scenario, Oslo police were conducting a bombing exercise at a location near the Oslo Opera House just 48 hours before a terrorist blast hit a government building in the Norwegian capital. According to the translated version of an Aftenposten report, \u201cAnti-terror police fired explosive charges at a training center in Oslo, two hundred meters from the Opera, but forgot to notify the public.\u201d The exercise occurred on Wednesday and revolved around anti-terror units attacking a disused building at the edge of Bj\u00f8rvika pier with bombs and firearms. \u201cThe men lowered themselves down from the roof and in through the window that had just been blown out, while they fired hand their weapons,\u201d states the report, noting that the exercise was \u201cdramatic,\u201d produced \u201cviolent bangs,\u201d and was watched by spectators at the nearby Opera House. A video of the drill that accompanies the story shows police scaling the side of a building with an explosion going off below them before they enter the window and start firing. Police had to publicly apologize today for not informing the public about the exercise. Although it\u2019s too early to judge the nature of this exercise, the fallback of a drill, which gives the state an excuse should any evidence of complicity in the real attack emerge, has been evident in previous major terror events, including both 7/7 and 9/11.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/oslo-police-conducted-bombing-exercise-days-before-terrorist-blast\r\n\r\nWhite al-Qaeda Narrative Emerging in Norway Terror Attack\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nUpdate: Police in Norway say the man accused of killing more than 20 people at a youth camp is connected to the bombing of government buildings. Security experts are speculating that the attacks in Norway are the work of both Islamists and right-wing extremists. \u201cSecurity experts say suspicion is likely to fall on both Islamists and right-wing extremists following a deadly bombing and a shooting at a political gathering in tranquil Norway,\u201d reports Reuters. \u201cIt was not clear if the attacks were linked, but the possibility of a complex, hybrid assault made it difficult to make an early call as to the likely political orientation of the assailants, security experts said.\" Following the bombing of Norway\u2019s main government building in the capital Oslo, there was a shooting incident at Utoeya, an island south of Oslo where Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s Labor party youth section\u2019s yearly gathering was taking place. The assailant was reportedly dressed as a policeman. He appeared to be Norwegian with blonde hair, thus fueling the right-wing element suggested by security experts.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/white-al-qaeda-narrative-emerging-in-norway-terror-attack\r\n\r\nOslo Bombing: Why Would \u201cTerrorists\u201d Attack Near-Empty Office Building on Public Holiday?\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nDaily Mail reports: Fortunately, it is a public holiday in Norway and the offices are less busy than a normal weekday. Why would \u201cterrorists,\u201d who presumably want to kill as many people as possible, choose to bomb the building on a day when they know it will be almost empty? Comment from a reader: I\u2019m from Norway and here are some little reported facts: 1) Fact: A person dressed as a cop has shot and killed at least 5 members of the youth organization of the governing labour party in their convention at Ut\u00f8ya. He is now captured. Comment: False cops? These are professionals. The shootings happened at the same time as the explosion, but far, far away from each other (several houres + you have to take a boat to get to the island). 2) Fact: The explosion took place downtown in the height of the holiday, with all the surrounding buildings (many important press, union and governmental buildings, including the labour party) being almost empty. At a normal day thousands would have been killed and wounded. Today, only a handful dead and wounded. Comment: Why would terrorists choose a timing with less impact? Now, if this is a black-operation in order to influence opinion, it makes sense. 3) Fact: My friend\u2019s father is a dynamiter blaster expert by profession. He has worked with explosions for 35 years. He noticed that the ground was raised so that the armouring which had been below the ground now lay above the ground. For this to happen the explosion have had to happen UNDER the ground, like if a gas tube had exploded (there was road/sewer work in the exact area for several days prior to this). When the ground is raised like this, as was apparent on the news, it can not have been a car bomb like the media speculates. People have been smelling sulphur all over downtown. Comment: Who had the resources to get access underground? Not the fundamentalist simpleton, to be sure. 4) Fact: After less than one hour the police concluded that it was a \u201cbomb\u201d. Comment: How can they have determined this so quickly? There has been complete chaos, people are evacuated and even corpses was not removed within an hour. How could they determine this so quickly? How could they rule out an accident in the gas pipes? This smells fishy. I will continue to update here from Oslo if anything else suspicious pops up.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/oslo-bombing-why-would-terrorists-attack-near-empty-office-building-on-public-holiday\r\n\r\nOslo Bombing: Is CIA Contact Krekar to Blame?\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nIt is too early to say who is responsible for the bombing of government buildings in Oslo, Norway, that killed at least two people and injured several others. The media is instinctively blaming al-Qaeda, but there is another possible culprit \u2013 Mullah Krekar and his Kurdish Islamist group Ansar al-Islam. On July 12, it was reported that a Norwegian prosecutor filed terror charges against the Iraqi-born cleric Krekar after he allegedly threatened Norwegian politicians with death if he\u2019s deported from the country. Krekar went to Norway in 1991 as a refugee from northern Iraq. Authorities from the Kurdistan regional government have repeatedly asked Norway to extradite Krekar for his role in terrorist attacks carried out by the group he founded, Ansar al-Islam. Members of the group are veterans of the CIA-ISI collaborative war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. The group killed an Australian journalist and is believed to involved in the attempted bombing of a DoD office in Arbil, Iraq, in 2003. Krekar has an interesting background. As I wrote in 2005, he was approached by the CIA to work with them. In 2003, he told the al-Hayat newspaper he had \u201ca meeting with a CIA representative and someone from the American army in the town of Sulaymaniya (Iraqi Kurdistan) at the end of 2000. They asked us to collaborate with them,\u201d an offer Krekar said he refused. Krekar threatened to expose his link to the CIA after the U.S. accused Ansar al-Islam of teaming up with al-Qaeda. \u201cI have in my possession irrefutable evidence against the Americans and I am prepared to supply it \u2026 if (the United States) tries to implicate me in an affair linked to terrorism,\u201d he told the newspaper.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/oslo-bombing-is-cia-contact-krekar-to-blame\r\n\r\nGiant blast hits government buildings in Oslo, Norway\r\nCNN\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nA giant explosion rocked government buildings in Oslo, Norway, on Friday, state TV broadcaster NRK said, with at least two people confirmed dead. Windows in several buildings had been blown out, and people were in the street bleeding, NRK said on its website. The cause of the blast remains unknown.

On the day that Janet Napolitano repeated rhetoric about \u201cdomestic terror\u201d being the primary security threat, a newly released DHS video caused outrage by depicting white Americans as the most likely terrorists. The footage illustrated a number of scenarios encouraging people to report suspicious activity, and in almost every case the evildoer was a white American and in not one case was the terrorist a Muslim or an Arab. Far from representing some superficial nod to political correctness, this is in fact a deliberate effort by the feds to characterize white, middle class, politically engaged Americans as domestic extremists. It\u2019s all part of the agenda to frame dissent against big government as dangerous radicalism. Contrary to claims by the DHS that it does not profile, the bulk of literature and other training tools issued by the federal government over the last decade clearly go to great lengths to demonize informed, middle class, and predominately white Americans as the most likely terrorists, despite the fact that the 126 people who were indicted on terrorist-related charges in the United States over the last two years were all Muslim.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/feds-profiling-whites-middle-class-americans-as-terrorists\r\n\r\nDHS Denies \u201cRacial Overtones\u201d In \u2018White Middle Class Terrorists\u2019 Video\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nFollowing widespread outrage yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security has ludicrously denied that a video it released encouraging Americans to report suspicious activity contains \u201cracial overtones,\u201d despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of people depicted as terrorists in the clip are white middle class Americans. The story, first featured on Infowars.com, went viral yesterday, appearing on the Drudge Report, Fox News, Breitbart.tv, the Daily Mail as well as featuring highly amongst the most read articles on the entire Internet during that 24 hour period. The Fox Nation version of the story received well over 2000 comments. The Department of Homeland Security was forced to issue a terse response to the controversy. The DHS confirm \u201cthe video is theirs but adamantly deny there are any racial or politically correct overtones to it.\u201d Really? Then why out of all the scenarios shown in the video that depict terrorists are no less than 12 of them white people and only three are minorities? In addition, of the people depicted as patriotic Americans for reporting the terrorists, only one of them is white seven are from minorities. Furthermore, at the start of the clip, the majority of citizens depicted as proud Americans and potential victims of terror are from minorities. Examples of terrorists who have been arrested in recent years are shown later in the clip \u2013 four are white Americans and only one is a foreign Muslim.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/dhs-denies-racial-overtones-in-white-middle-class-terrorists-video\r\n\r\nBeware of a Possible False Flag Event, Media & Feds Pushing Fear for 10th Anniversary of 9/11 (video)\r\nFederal Jack\r\nJuly 21, 2011\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/nzqgPF6nHfk\r\n\r\nGrassley Sees DOJ Cover Up in \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019 Investigation\r\nCNS News\r\nJuly 21, 2011\r\n\r\nA senior Senate Republican has accused the Justice Department of a \u201ccover-up\u201d by limiting information to Congress about a botched gun running program along the southwest border. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to cover up now by not giving us all the information that we want,\u201d Sen.

The warning was sent out on Tuesday. \u201cBased on the reliable reporting of previous incidents, we have high confidence in our judgment that insiders and their actions pose a significant threat to the infrastructure and information systems of U.S. facilities,\u201d the bulletin states. \u201cPast events and reporting also provide high confidence in our judgment that insider information on sites, infrastructure, networks, and personnel is valuable to our adversaries and may increase the impact of any attack on the utilities infrastructure.\u201d The feds cite a supposed intelligence trove discovered at a house in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was allegedly killed by Navy SEALS. The government has yet to provide conclusive evidence of the assassination and changed important details of its narrative numerous times. Neighbors in Abbottabad said they never saw the six foot five terrorist at the compound where he was allegedly killed and describe the much lauded assassination as a hoax. Information supposedly gleaned from this unsubstantiated trove is at the heart of the latest DHS effort to frighten Americans into accepting the ongoing conversion of America into a Gestapo police state.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/latest-dhs-fear-mongering-al-qaeda-plans-to-take-out-nuke-plant\r\n\r\nDHS Video Characterizes White Americans as Most Likely Terrorists\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 21, 2011\r\n\r\nA new promotional video released by the Department of Homeland Security characterizes white middle class Americans as the most likely terrorists, as Big Sis continues its relentless drive to cement the myth that mad bombers are hiding around every corner, when in reality Americans are just as likely to be killed by lightning strikes or peanut allergies. The video is part of Homeland Security\u2019s $10 million dollar \u201cSee Something, Say Something\u201d program that encourages Americans to report \u201csuspicious activity,\u201d which in every case throughout history has been a trait of oppressive, dictatorial regimes. In the course of the 10 minute clip, a myriad of different behaviors are characterized as terrorism, including opposing surveillance, using a video camera, talking to police officers, wearing hoodies, driving vans, writing on a piece of paper, and using a cell phone recording application. Despite encouraging viewers not to pay attention to a person\u2019s race in determining whether or not they may be a terrorist, almost all of the scenarios in the clip proceed to portray white people as the most likely terrorists. Bizarrely, nearly every single one of the \u201cpatriotic\u201d Americans who reports on their fellow citizen is either black, Asian or Arab. Imagine if the video had portrayed every terrorist as an Arab and every patriotic snoop as white, there\u2019d be an outcry and rightly so, but this strange reversal must have been deliberate on the part of the DHS, but why?

As the country prepares to commemorate the anniversary of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Napolitano expects questions about whether the U.S. is safer than it was 10 years ago, after all of the security enhancements and the targeted killing of terror leader Osama bin Laden. \"The answer is yes, but there are no guarantees in a world of ever-evolving threats,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview. The Sept. 11 attacks prompted the largest government reorganization in decades, drastically changed U.S. security policies and led to billions in spending to strengthen U.S. terrorism defenses. Many of the changes, such as the linkages of federal intelligence databases and deployment of nuclear detection technology at ports, are not obvious to the American public. But a trip through one of the country's 457 airports is an instant reminder of how much has changed.\r\nhttp://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110721/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_napolitano_interview\r\n\r\nEven Dead, Osama Has a Winning Strategy (Hint: It\u2019s Muhammad Ali\u2019s)\r\nDanger Room (Wired.com)\r\nJuly 20, 2011\r\n\r\nOsama bin Laden is dead.

Scenes from the proposed short film show young boys dressed in battle fatigues and participating in raids, killings and terror plots. It is the latest attempt by the terror organization to use multimedia to draw in potential recruits. Recently, a Yemen-based extremist group released an online women's magazine with makeup and chastity tips. News of the animated film was announced by a group called Abu al-Laith al-Yemen on the Arabic-language al-Shamouk jihadist website, the London-based Quilliam Foundation reported Wednesday. Quilliam, which was formed by former jihadists and now aims to stamp out extremism, said it appears the group is affiliated with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. \"It's a Disney-like film aimed at kids that tells stories of the Prophet, stories of holy wars and anti-Western propaganda,\" said Noman Benotman, a former jihadist with links to al-Qaida who is now an analyst at Quilliam. \"But I think it could backfire.

Destroys FBI Case Then Does A 180 Reversal Days Later\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 20, 2011\r\n\r\nIn a remarkable turn of events that has been relatively buried in the headlines this week, the Justice Department called into serious question a key pillar of the criminal case against the FBI\u2019s prime suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks, before completely reversing it\u2019s own conclusion just days later... In the filing dated July 15, Justice Department lawyers noted that the Army\u2019s biodefense center at Fort Detrick, Md., \u201cdid not have the specialized equipment in a containment laboratory that would be required to prepare the dried spore preparations that were used in the letters.\u201d In other words, Ivins\u2019 lab, often referred to as the \u201chot suite\u201d, did not contain the equipment needed to turn liquid anthrax into the refined powder that ended up being mailed to members of the Senate and reporters in the fall of 2001.... Ivins, who was found dead in 2008 from an apparent suicide at the same time the government was about to indict him, was identified by the FBI\u2019s \u201cAmerithrax Task Force\u201d as the lone perpetrator of the attacks that killed five people and infected 17 others in the weeks immediately following 9/11. The FBI based it\u2019s entire case against Ivins on the fact that the microbiologist had access to the necessary equipment in the government lab at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases where he worked. When the Justice Department realized that the latest court filing cast serious doubt on these claims about the anthrax attack, it did a 180 flip flop and sent the court a \u201clist of corrections\u201d. What the filing should have said, the department wrote, was that while the Army lab did not have a lyophilizer, a freeze-drying machine, in the space where Dr. Ivins usually worked, there was a lyophilizer and other equipment in the building that he could have used to dry the anthrax into powder. Even if this was the case, which is still highly questionable, it still significantly weakens the case against Ivins as the lone assailant, because it means he would have had to have access different areas of the building and use the equipment in those areas for some time without being noticed. It also means that the fact that others who worked in the lab were not sickened becomes even more of a key indicator that Ivins did not prepare the anthrax spores as the FBI and the government has claimed he did.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/anthrax-attacks-justice-dept-destroys-fbi-case-then-does-a-180-reversal-days-later\r\n\r\nReport: NZ quake exposes possible Israeli spy ring\r\nNewspaper: One victim may have been agent, and police computers may have been target\r\nmsnbc.com\r\nJuly 20, 2011\r\n\r\nOne of the victims of the February earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, may have been an Israeli spy, according to a report in The Southland Times. The man, Ofer Benyamin Mizrahi, was carrying five passports with him at the time of his death, according to the Times. The newspaper's reports centered around a possible breach of New Zealand's national police computers... Misrahi and 3 other people were in a van that was crushed by a falling pillar. Misrahi was killed, but the others were able to extricate themselves, the Times said. Mizrahi's 3 companions, 1 man and 1 women, photographed the crushed van and rendezvoused at a city square that Israeli officials had designated an \"emergency meeting point,\" then were able to travel back to Israel within 12 hours, The Southland Times said. New Zealand authorities later confronted an \"unaccredited Israeli search and rescue squad\" and removed it from the sealed-off area in the city, the Times said. This squad was one of two private search parties brought from Israel to New Zealand, without prior coordination with local authorities in New Zealand, Haaretz reported.... Adding to the intrigue is a comment posted on the website of Pravda, a Russian newspaper. The comment said the earthquake disrupted an Israeli spy base in Christchurch.\r\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43817498/ns/world_news-asia_pacific\r\n\r\nMass Murder Merger: Petraeus Moves to CIA\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 19, 2011\r\n\r\nThe elite have once gain shuffled the deck. This time the consummate bureaucrat and insider Leon Panetta moves to the Defense Department and Gen. David Petraeus sets sail for the CIA. But the move is more than a game of musical chairs. Petraeus will manage the next phase of the so-called war on terror. As Jack D. Douglas notes for LewRockwell.com, Petraeus \u201chas become the official head of the CIA to consolidate the Murder Black Ops of the CIA with those of the military forces. The Murder Drone Ops are being very rapidly expanded into a worldwide Murder and Invasion Special Ops Force.\u201d In addition to killing civilians designated al-Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan\u2019s unruly tribal area, the Drone Ops are moving into Yemen and Somalia. The corporate media, reading their Pentagon scripts closely, have described this as Obama\u2019s bold new anti-terror policy following the unsubstantiated but widely accepted (by the corporate media) assassination of the dialysis patient Osama bin Laden. \u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s increased focus on Somalia comes as the White House has unveiled a new strategy to battle al-Qaida in the post-Osama bin Laden era, and as some U.S. military and intelligence officials view al-Qaida affiliates in Yemen and Somalia as a greater threat to the United States than the group of operatives in Pakistan who have been barraged with hundreds of drone strikes directed by the CIA in recent years,\u201d the Grand Master of establishment propaganda, the New York Times, reported last week. Al-Qaeda in Yemen is allegedly run by American citizen and Pentagon dinner guest, Anwar Awlaki. He has successfully managed a number of remarkably incompetent patsies and drooling idiots who are portrayed as al-Qaeda\u2019s ominous shock troops. Yemen represents an important landmark in the evolving war on cave dwellers and other largely mythical enemies of the empire.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/mass-murder-merger-petraeus-moves-to-cia\r\n\r\nTerrified phone-hacking whistleblower feared for his life before he was found dead\r\nUK Daily Mail\r\nJuly 19, 2011\r\n\r\nThe man who launched the entire phone hacking scandal had become a paranoid recluse who believed someone was out to get him, a friend has revealed.

He was yellow in colour and wasn\u2019t looking well for the last month. \u2018He had a constant struggle with alcohol and talked to me about how much he had put his wife through. \u2018He did say something about phone hacking and I think that was his main worry. He had definite concerns with the media. He did mention he was paranoid and would mention conspiracy stuff.\u2019 Former News of the World journalist Mr Hoare had accused former Tory media chief Andy Coulson of lying about his role in the affair.\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2016132/Sean-Hoare-dead-No-involved-phone-hacking-whistleblowers-death.html\r\n\r\nPost-9/11, biggest terror threat is underground\r\nAssociated Press\r\nJuly 18, 2011\r\n\r\nNEW YORK \u2013 It's the morning rush in the Times Square subway station, a routine convergence of humanity and mass transit that makes New York City hum. Mixing seamlessly with subway riders are New York Police Department officers with heavy body armor and high-powered rifles, commanders in blue NYPD polo shirts carrying smart phone-size radiation detectors and a panting police dog named Sabu. \"This is the new normal,\" Inspector Scott Shanley of the NYPD's Counterterrorism Division says. \"The only people who sometimes get raised up are tourists.\" Since terrorists brought down the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001, subways have been bombed in terror attacks across the world, including in Madrid, London and this spring in Minsk, Belarus. The possibility that New York's sprawling, porous and famously gritty subway system could be next has become a constant worry \u2014 leading to a new normal of suspicious package alerts, bomb-sniffing dogs, cameras trained on commuters and passengers listening to the missive, \"if you see something, say something.\" The campaigns encouraging residents to report suspicious activity strike Manhattan writer Anne Nelson, 57, as Orwellian. \"New York is about expression and life and vibrancy,\" she said, walking through Times Square. \"It's not about living in an atmosphere of fear.\" But authorities here believe a serious attack on the 24-hour subway system with more than 400 stations, would potentially cripple the city in ways worse than the Sept. 11 attack \u2014 a concern shared by U.S. cities and countries reliant on mass transit and viewed as enemies by terrorists.\r\nhttp://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110718/ap_on_re_us/us_sept11_subways\r\n\r\nWas TWA 800 Shot Down By a Military Missile?\r\nWhat Really Happened\r\nJuly 18, 2011\r\n\r\nIn 1996 TWA Flight 800 was shot down south of Long Island. The government of the United States, despite the embarrassment of having been caught in court rigging lab tests and lying in its reports, still officially attributes the disaster to a spark in the center fuel tank, while government spokespeople insist that the witnesses who saw a missile hit the jumbo jet are all drunks. On the evening of July 17th, 1996, shortly after the sun had set, but while the sky was still light, a Boeing 747-131 jetliner, TWA's flight 800, was taking off from JFK airport on its way to Paris, France. On board were 230 people. Approximately 11 minutes into the flight, the 747 was flying at an altitude of 13,700 MSL, or 13,700 feet above sea level. Normally higher at 11 minutes, flight 800 had delayed climbing to make room for another jetliner descending into Rhode Island. The plane was over the Atlantic ocean south of Long Island, New York. Just as flight 800 received clearance to initiate a climb to cruise altitude, the plane exploded without any warning. Thousands of pounds of kerosene, dumped from the center and wing tanks, vaporized and ignited, creating a fireball seen all along the coastline of Long Island. Under the orange glow of the fireball, sections of the 747 tumbled into the ocean. So completely had the plane broken up that weather radar confused the expanding bubble of debris for a cloud....\r\nhttp://whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/CRASH/TWA/twa.php\r\n\r\nExperts Warn of al-Qaeda Attack If Debt Ceiling Not Raised\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 17, 2011\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not enough to frighten Americans with personal financial disaster if the massive debt scam is not perpetuated. In order to send the message, the government has decided to stoke up the al-Qaeda threat.\r\nphotoLet the bankers crank up the debt even more or this cave dweller and his operatives will get you. According to counterterrorism experts polled by Homeland Security Today, a possible downgrading of the U.S. credit rating by Moody\u2019s \u2013 and the mayhem in financial markets that would result \u2013 may inspire al-Qaeda to attack. \u201cSo you can understand why Al Qaeda, or any other terrorist organization motivated by the jihadist ideology, would see that America is highly vulnerable right now \u2013 perhaps more than it\u2019s ever been \u2014 to an attack or attacks the impact or direct effect [of which] would be further depression of the US\u2019s economy,\u201d a counterterrorism official told the homeland security affairs website. The credit ratings company Moody\u2019s has renewed its warning that if the United States defaults on its \u201cdebt obligations\u201d after the deadline set by the Treasury, it may downgrade its AAA bond rating. The debt is well over $100 trillion, although the government tells us it is a paltry $14 trillion. Obama, the Federal Reserve, and the bankers want to raise the debt limit from $14.3 to $14.5 trillion so Congress can borrow and spend even more money. Most of the budget is spent on killing people in foreign lands. Obama threatened the most vulnerable last week. He said the government will stop sending Social Security payments to seniors if Congress does not agree to raise the debt ceiling. He didn\u2019t say missing the deadline would shut down the wars in Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Gary Sasse, director of the Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University in Rhode Island, told Fox News a downgrade by Moody\u2019s would reach \u201cdown to every family in America.\u201d Fox said the ripple effect from a downgrade would be widespread and potentially severe, impacting everything from local municipalities and the neighborhood bank to home mortgages and student loans. But this threat is apparently not enough to scare Americans. Now the government is dragging a threadbare al-Qaeda out of the closet and waving it in our faces.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/experts-warn-of-al-qaeda-attack-if-debt-ceiling-not-raised\r\n\r\nGun-smuggling cartel figures possibly were paid FBI informants\r\nLA Times\r\nJuly 17, 2011\r\n\r\nCongressional investigators probing the controversial \u201cFast and Furious\u201d anti-gun-trafficking operation on the border with Mexico believe at least six Mexican drug cartel figures involved in gun smuggling also were paid FBI informants, officials said Saturday. The investigators have asked the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration for details about the alleged informants, as well as why agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which ran the Fast and Furious operation, were not told about them. The development raises further doubts about the now-shuttered program, which was created in November 2009 in an effort to track guns across the border and unravel the cartels\u2019 gun smuggling networks. The gun tracing largely failed, however, and hundreds of weapons purchased in U.S. shops later were found at crime scenes in Mexico. The scandal has angered Mexican officials and some members of Congress. Investigators say nearly 2,500 guns were allowed to flow illegally into Mexico under the ATF program, fueling the drug violence ravaging that country and leading to the shooting death of a U.S. border agent.\r\nhttp://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-cartel-guns-20110717,0,6972222.story\r\n\r\nMumbai blasts detainee reportedly dies of torture\r\nXinhuanet\r\nJuly 17, 2011\r\n\r\nNEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A man, involved in the July 13 Mumbai blasts, reportedly died of police torture during interrogation, according to media reports on Sunday. Faiz Usmani died following a brain hemorrhage early Sunday, reported Indo-Asian News Service, quoting hospital sources. The report quoted a medical officer as saying that Faiz Usmani was picked up as a suspect in the triple blasts, which left 19 people dead and 129 others injured, but late Saturday evening he suddenly took ill and was rushed to Sion Hospital in Mumbai. He died there around 1:20 a.m. Sunday. The officer said when Faiz was brought to hospital, his blood pressure was in excess of 220 points and there was a large amount of blood in his brain, said the report. Faiz was the brother of Afzal Usmani, one of the prime accused in blasts in Ahmedabad and Surat in Gujarat in 2008, and both were suspected members of the Indian Mujahiddeen. The family members of Faiz said he was tortured by police.\r\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-07/17/c_13990516.htm\r\n\r\nSan Rafael man arrested for making death threats to Sen. Boxer\r\nBay City News Service\r\nJuly 16, 2011\r\n\r\nSAN RAFAEL -- A San Rafael man was arrested this morning for allegedly making death threats to U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer. A series of threatening messages were left on the voice mail of the senator's office voice mail after business hours during the week of July 10, 2011, according to San Rafael police. Police were contacted earlier this week, and an investigation identified the caller as Kevin Joseph O'Connell. O'Connell, 47, was arrested near his home on East Francisco Boulevard and booked into Marin County Jail on one count of making criminal threats. Bail is set at $500,000 and he is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday, July 19th at 9 a.m.\r\nhttp://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_18492688?nclick_check=1\r\n\r\nIran lawmaker: US behind Iraq unrest\r\nPressTV\r\nJul 16, 2011\r\n\r\nA senior Iranian lawmaker says Tehran believes the US is responsible for the acts of terrorism carried out in Shia or Sunni-populated regions of Iraq. \u201cIran considers the invaders of Iraq responsible for terrorist activities in the Shia- and Sunni-populated areas [of Iraq],\u201d Fars News Agency quoted Deputy head of Iran's Majlis (Parliament) National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Hossein Ebrahimi as saying on Saturday. \u201c[Iran] asks all the Muslims of Iraq to dash the hopes of the US through maintaining their solidarity,\u201d he added. The Iranian lawmaker made the remarks after three explosions targeted Muslims pilgrims near the holy city of Karbala in central Iraq, killing nine people and wounding 70 others. The blasts came as visitors are overwhelming the city to attend the celebrations marking the birth anniversary of the 12th Shia Imam, Mahdi (PBUH). Ebrahimi described the terrorist attacks as US measures to widen the religious rifts in the violence-hit country. \u201cThe Americans, through bombings in Karbala and [carrying out] acts of terrorism in Shia-populated areas, seek to frame Sunni brothers of acting against the Shia but the vigilance of the Shias will thwart this US conspiracy,\u201d the official said.\r\nhttp://www.presstv.ir/detail/189376.html\r\n\r\nKarzai Hitman Worked for CIA and U.S. Special Forces\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 16, 2011\r\n\r\nA British newspaper reports today that the man who assassinated Ahmed Wali Karzai, the brother of Afghan president Hamid Karzai, worked for the CIA and U.S. Special Forces. In 2009, we reported that Karzai was the suspected kingpin of the country\u2019s booming opium trade. At that time, he was on the CIA payroll for eight years, according to the New York Times. \u201cOfficials quoted by The Times described Karzai as a Mafia-like figure who expanded his influence over the drug trade with the aid of U.S. efforts to eliminate his competitors,\u201d Paul Joseph Watson wrote on October 28, 2009. Sardar Mohammad, the bodyguard who gunned down Karzai, held regular meetings with British officials and had two brothers-in-law serving in a CIA-run paramilitary unit, the Kandahar Strike Force, the Washington Post reported yesterday. On July 12, following the assassination, the media reported that the Taliban had put out a hit on the half brother of Afghanistan\u2019s U.S.-installed president, a former employee of Unocal. \u201cThe Taliban asserted responsibility for Karzai\u2019s killing, and a U.S. official confirmed that the insurgent group may have influenced Mohammad, who had commanded checkpoints in the Karzai family\u2019s ancestral village,\u201d the Washington Post reported. The Post admits, however, that the Taliban may not have killed Karzai. As Kandahar provincial council chief, Ahmed Wali Karzai was a symbol of the venality of Afghanistan\u2019s new U.S.-installed ruling elite. It is said he had a long list of enemies from \u201chis business and political dealings.\u201d The Post minimizes his role as overlord of the country\u2019s thriving opium trade. Predictably, the Post follows its Pentagon script closely and states the assassination \u201cunderscores the continued vulnerability of Afghan officials as the United States prepares to reduce its military presence, and likely will complicate U.S. efforts to bolster security in southern Afghanistan.\u201d \r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/karzai-hitman-worked-for-cia-and-u-s-special-forces\r\n\r\nClinton Announces al-Qaeda as Legitimate Government of Libya\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 16, 2011\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and members of more than 30 other nations meet in Istanbul, Turkey, and announced they have granted al-Qaeda and the so-called rebels in Libya full diplomatic recognition. \u201cI am announcing today that, until an interim authority is in place, the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya,\u2019\u2019 said Clinton. The TNC, or Transitional National Council, is dominated by the the Haribi tribe of northeastern Libya. Both Abdel Mustafa Jalil and Abdel Fatah Younis \u2013 routinely paraded around by the corporate media as Libya\u2019s new leaders \u2013 are from the Haribi tribe. A 2007 West Point study concluded that the tribe is rife with al-Qaeda and actively killed U.S. troops in Iraq. See Webster Tarpley on this, here. Peter Dale Scott has also written about the rebels, specifically the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and its connection to the CIA and its war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. The LIFG was created by British and U.S. intelligence to assassinate Gaddafi. According to Yoichi Shimatsu, writing for New American Media, the LIFG is \u201cthe most radical element in the Al Qaeda network.\u201d Naturally, you hear nothing about al-Qaeda and the rebels from the New York Times or the crown jewel of Operation Mockingbird, the Washington Post. Instead, the corporate media insists Gaddafi and al-Qaeda will wage a holy war against the United States. Clinton announced yesterday that the United States has recognized as the legitimate government of Libya a CIA created terrorist group it has waged a fake war against for almost a decade.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/clinton-announces-al-qaeda-as-legitimate-government-of-libya/\r\n\r\nTony Farrell: British Whistle Blower Fired for Exposing 9/11 as \u201cState Sponsored Terror\u201d\r\nThe Alex Jones Channel\r\nJuly 14, 2011\r\n\r\nA British police intelligence analyst who was asked to create a strategic assessment concerning terror threats was fired when he told his superiors that the threat of an \u201cinternal tyranny\u201d was far greater than that of Islamic terrorism, after discovering that both 7/7 and 9/11 were false flag attacks.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/tony-farrell-british-whistle-blower-fired-for-exposing-911-as-state-sponsored-terror\r\n\r\nFBI opens inquiry after report that News Corp. tried to hack phones of 9/11 victims\r\nWashington Post\r\nJuly 14, 2011\r\n\r\nThe FBI has opened a preliminary inquiry into allegations that News Corp. employees sought to hack into the phones of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and tried to bribe law enforcement officers for information, U.S. officials said Thursday. FBI agents are reviewing information on the phone-hacking scandal engulfing Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British media operations and trying to determine if U.S. laws were broken, the officials said. Murdoch is chairman and chief executive of News Corp., which is based in New York and has extensive U.S. operations. While it is unclear if the review will expand into a full investigation, the FBI\u2019s involvement heightens the scrutiny faced by the media giant, which is under intense fire in Britain over allegations that its journalists hacked into the phones of thousands of people.\r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-examining-alleged-news-corp-phone-hacking/2011/07/14/gIQA807ZEI_story.html\r\n\r\nPolice Intelligence Analyst Fired For Blowing Whistle On False Flag Terror\r\nInfowars.com\r\nWednesday, July 13, 2011\r\n\r\nA British police intelligence analyst who was asked to create a strategic assessment concerning terror threats was fired when he told his superiors that the threat of an \u201cinternal tyranny\u201d was far greater than that of Islamic terrorism, after discovering that both 7/7 and 9/11 were false flag attacks. Tony Farrell, who has a university degree in statistics, was employed for 12 years as a \u2018Police Intelligence Analyst\u2019 with South Yorkshire Police. His job was to provide a yearly \u2018Strategic Threat Assessment Matrix\u2019 to enable police to prioritize resources and activities. Fully expecting Farrell to regurgitate the contention that Muslim extremists posed the biggest threat, his bosses were stunned when Farrell instead reported that the 2005 London bombings were staged by British intelligence and that the official story was a \u201cmonstrous lie\u201d. During an hour-long interview with Richard D. Hall which was broadcast nationwide on UK television last week, Farrell revealed how one week before the 5th anniversary of 7/7 in 2010, he began researching information suggesting that the official story behind 9/11 was a total fabrication. Farrell cites the Alex Jones Show as being instrumental in his awakening to this knowledge. After sharing his concerns with the resident police church minister, it was suggested to Farrell that he also investigate the July 2005 London bombings. \u201cSomething he had not suspected \u2018in his wildest dreams\u2019 then started to unfold,\u201d writes Nick Kollerstrom. \u201cAfter reading much of the available but publicly-unreported witness statements and other evidence relating to 7/7, Tony found that he could only conclude that the official 7/7 narrative was \u2018a monstrous lie.\u2019 Instead of the official \u2018suicide bombers\u2019 narrative, which he and all of his colleagues had believed without question, he realized that the weight of evidence strongly points far more towards 7/7 being an event stage-managed by British intelligence than anything else.\u201d With the deadline fast approaching for Farrell to present his report to the Intelligence Strategic Management Board, he struggled with his conscience, well aware that if he divulged his contention that internal tyranny and not domestic or Islamic terrorism was the primary threat, he could easily lose his job and with it a 12-year career.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/police-intelligence-analyst-fired-for-blowing-whistle-on-false-flag-terror\r\n\r\nBombshell: Saudi and U.S. Governments Protected Hijackers\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 12, 2011\r\n\r\nAppearing on MSNBC, former senator and Florida governor Bob Graham said at least two of the purported 9/11 hijackers had assistance from Saudi Arabia. Graham\u2019s recently released novel, Keys to the Kingdom, implicates the Saudis. He told MSNBC to novel is based on factual information. Graham said there are a lot of unanswered questions surrounding the role played by Saudi Arabia. He also asked why the government prevented Congress from obtaining information on the September 11, 2011, attack and its relationship to Saudi Arabia. In 2009, the Bush administration refused to release a congressional report alleging possible links between Saudi Arabian officials and the hijackers. Bush said he could not comply with a request by the Saudi foreign minister for a chance to clear the Arab kingdom\u2019s name because publication of the report could hurt U.S. intelligence operations, according to news reports. Sources revealed that a redacted section of the report describes a money trail between Saudi Arabia and supporters of al-Qaeda. \r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/bombshell-saudi-and-u-s-governments-protected-hijackers\r\n\r\nMexican Outlaws Get Guns Via ATF\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 12, 2011\r\n\r\nLegal guns originating in the United States are the illegal guns that are being used to slaughter citizens in Mexico. And in a nation where gun ownership is illegal, it could not be more apparent that when guns are outlawed, the only ones with guns are the outlaws. But just how the outlaws get the guns is shocking. Members of both the U.S. Congress and the Mexican government are calling for prosecution of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). Congressional testimony has recently turned the ATF on its head after whistleblowers gave testimony revealing that the ATF played a part in the release of guns into Mexico. For at least a decade now, covert operation specialist Celerino \u201cCele\u201d Castillo III has been telling the world that the U.S. has been shipping guns south of the border on a regular basis as a sidebar to revelations of drug running from South America into North America. And now in the summer of 2011, the BATF is under fire for observing the sale and distribution of machine guns into Mexico. Congressional testimony in recent months is revealing a calculated plan called Operation Fast and Furious. Amazingly, thousands of guns have been observed to be purchased illegally and then tracked to an exit point outside of the USA. Testimony also reveals that the U.S. Border Patrol has been implicated in the plot. The ultimate end of the plan is to make possession of guns the ultimate evil. It\u2019s a devious plan that includes what amounts to deliberate distribution of armament to a nation that has been taught to hate the USA.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/mexican-outlaws-get-guns-via-atf\r\n\r\nWikileaks\u2019 Assange to Address 9/11 Conspiracy?\r\nPrison Planet Live\r\nJuly 12, 2011\r\n\r\nJulian Assange may be about to address concerns over his comments last year that 9/11 truth was a \u201cfalse conspiracy\u201d which he found \u201cannoying\u201d. Assange made the statement despite Wikileaks\u2019 2009 release of half a million pager messages on the day of 9/11 from New York City officials, many of which contradicted the official story. The Wikileaks founder is currently in London embroiled in an extradition appeal relating to allegations of rape, which many suspect are unfounded and part of a smear campaign against Assange. An increasing number of activists are questioning Assange\u2019s motives, including some of his former colleagues like Cryptome\u2019s John Young. However, we have noted that Anonymous, the hacking collective that has vigorously defended Assange, is doing excellent work in exposing the power elite head on, particularly with their intention to shine a light on the secretive gathering of globalists at this week\u2019s Bohemian Grove confab. We hope that Assange can take a moment to address these concerns and reassure supporters that he is fully committed to exposing sinister secrets, whatever they may reveal, and particularly if they relate to 9/11, which was the foundation of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq which Assange so vehemently opposes.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/wikileaks-assange-to-address-911-conspiracy\r\n\r\nAfghan CIA Drug Kingpin Shot Dead by Own Bodyguard\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 12, 2011\r\n\r\nAhmad Wali Karzai, the half brother of Afghan president Hamid Karzai, was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards Tuesday morning.
