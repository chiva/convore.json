Friday's interrogation will be only the second interview after police quizzed Breivik on Saturday, the morning after his shooting rampage on Utoeya island and the bomb blast in Oslo that killed 76 people. As questions grew over claims he had carried a walkie-talkie during his rampage and his own assertion that he had accomplices, the country's chief prosecutor also said the 32-year old suspect would not face trial until 2012. But later in the report, Norwegian police seem to downplay the possibility of other players. Not sure whether these quotes are from before or after the leads about the walkie talkie or Brievek's latest admission that he has accomplices.\r\nhttp://wakeupfromyourslumber.com/blog/qrswave/reports-breivik-carried-walkie-talkie-during-rampage\r\n\r\nMEDIA FAIL: Foxnews Uses Norway Attacks To Push Homegrown Terror Myth Inside America (video)\r\nFederal Jack\r\nJuly 29, 2011\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRXCbz4v6Oc\r\n\r\nMore Christian terrorism?

To many, it may come as a relief that Breivik's claims of being just one of several killer cells in some wider conspiracy for global domination turns out to be nothing but a web of deception spun by a brutal killer. But investigators and counterterrorism officials are not relieved. They fear that Breivik represents a new, potentially deadly paradigm shift in the world of extremist violence.\r\nhttp://old.news.yahoo.com/s/time/20110729/wl_time/08599208565800\r\n\r\nU.S. Treasury Pushes War Propaganda Claim al-Qaeda and Iran in Cahoots\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 29, 2011\r\n\r\nIn the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, the Bush neocons insisted Saddam Hussein was working with and sheltering al-Qaeda. The U.S. claims Iran is harboring al-Qaeda\u2019s Saif al-Adel. In December of 2001, then vice president Dick Cheney said Saddam Hussein had trained al-Qaeda on the use of chemical and biological weapons. Cheney said there was a connection between Mohammed Atta, supposedly the 9/11 lead hijacker, and Iraq. The Bush neocons, led by Cheney and then Sec. Def. Rumsfeld, \u201cstovepiped\u201d misleading and fabricated information about an al-Qaeda link to Iraq to the New York Times and the corporate media. Despite the fact the supposed link was discredited, Cheney reasserted it in 2007. It was disputed by the CIA and the 9/11 commission. The imagined terror link became part of the narrative used to justify the invasion of Iraq that ultimately killed over a million people. The Obama administration is following in the footsteps of the Bush administration. On Thursday, Obama\u2019s Treasury Department accused Iran of entering into a \u201csecret deal\u201d with al-Qaeda. David S. Cohen said Iran entered a \u201csecret deal with al-Qaida allowing it to funnel funds and operatives through its territory.\u201d Like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the neocons, Cohen did not provide any evidence to back up his claim.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/u-s-treasury-pushes-war-propaganda-claim-al-qaeda-and-iran-in-cahoots\r\n\r\nFormer officials: Al-Qaida still likely to use WMD\r\nAssociated Press\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nASPEN, Colo. \u2013 A chemical or biological attack by al-Qaida and its offshoots remains a threat, despite the killing of terror leader Osama bin Laden, top former U.S. counterterrorist officials said Thursday. \"We still have pockets of al-Qaida around the world who see this as a key way to fight us,\" especially the offshoot in Yemen, Mike Leiter, the just-retired director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told an audience at the Aspen Security Forum. \"The potential threat from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is very real.\" Leiter said the new breed of terrorists understands that killing a few Americans can cause as much fear as the massive plots bin Laden backed. \"The most likely ... are simple forms of chemical or biological weapons\" rather than a nuclear attack, Leiter said, using the poison ricin as an example of something that's easily made. \"Is it going to kill many people? No. Is it going to scare people? Yes,\" he said.\r\nhttp://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110728/ap_on_go_ot/us_al_qaida_wmd\r\n\r\nStudy: Terror cult's persistence key to WMD attack\r\nAssociated Press\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Experts argue over how hard it is for terrorists to make weapons of mass destruction, but a new study of the doomsday cult that carried out the Tokyo subway nerve gas attack says that even seemingly marginal groups can succeed with persistence and luck. A report on the Aum Shinrikyo cult by ex-Navy Secretary Richard Danzig and colleagues at the Center for a New Security describes the cult's often bumbling efforts to make biological and chemical weapons in the 1980s and 1990s. But the report says that the cult's persistence was key to its success in making sarin nerve agent, which it used in its deadly 1995 attack on Tokyo commuters that killed 13 and injured more than 6,000.\r\nhttp://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110728/ap_on_re_us/us_lessons_from_japan_cult\r\n\r\nOfficial: Soldier said he wanted to attack Fort Hood troops\r\nCNN\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nKilleen, Texas (CNN) -- An AWOL Muslim American Army private arrested near Fort Hood has told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow soldiers at the military post, the police chief in Killeen, Texas, said Thursday. \"Military personnel were a target of this suspect,\" Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters about Pfc.

State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters that the U.S. would be \u201csympathetic\u201d to the request, after which rebel supporters unfurled their flag outside the embassy where Gaddafi\u2019s regime is still in control. The United States formally recognized the rebel council as the country\u2019s legitimate government earlier this month, despite the fact that the rebel army is spearheaded by Al-Qaeda terrorists who are supposedly the target of a multi-decade \u201cwar on terror\u201d that is now in its tenth year and has cost the U.S. a staggering $5.4 trillion since 9/11.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/obama-to-approve-al-qaeda-embassy-in-washington\r\n\r\nMedia Dwells on Alleged Second Fort Hood Attack Following Norway Carnage\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nLess than a week after the bombing and shooting in Norway, the corporate media is reporting that a Muslim possessing weapons and explosives was apprehended near Fort Hood, Texas, the site of a deadly shooting attributed to Major Nidal Hasan in 2009. Jason Abdo Nassar, an AWOL soldier from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was arrested on Wednesday in the city of Killeen, Texas, according to the FBI. The BBC reports Nassar attempted to buy guns near the base and was found with bomb-making materials. CBS adds that he asked gun store employee how to make a bomb. He allegedly told police about a plan to kill and injure people. \u201cWhatever threat Mr. Nassar posed yesterday has been eliminated and mitigated, and there was nothing to indicate he was acting with anyone else,\u201d said Eric Vasys, a FBI special agent in San Antonio. The establishment media is portraying the story as a foiled terror attack. Fox News posted an \u201cexclusive\u201d report on its website today stating the soldier raised \u201csecurity concerns\u201d and was specifically arrested in a plot to attack Ford Hood. Nassar, however, does not fit the stereotypical description of a Muslim terrorist.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/media-dwells-on-alleged-second-fort-hood-attack-following-norway-carnage\r\n\r\nJackson Lee: Let\u2019s \u2018Have a Hearing on Right-Wing Extremists, Ideologues\u2019\r\nCNS News\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nAt a hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security today about the radicalization of young Somali American Muslims by the al-Shabaab terrorist group, Rep.

Jackson Lee used much of her allotted five minutes to question panelists with expertise on radicalization about the alleged hacking into telephones of 9-11 victims by the now-closed News of the World tabloid in England. \u201cI would add to that, that I would like to have a hearing on right-wing extremists, ideologues who advocate violence and advocate, in essence, the terrorizing of certain groups,\u201d Jackson Lee said. Before Jackson Lee was recognized by Rep.

(AP) -- The top commander of U.S. special operations forces said Wednesday that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida is bloodied and \"nearing its end,\" but he warned the next generation of militants could keep special operations fighting for a decade to come. Navy SEAL Adm. Eric T. Olson described the killing of bin Laden by a special operations raid on May 2 as a near-killing blow for what he called \"al-Qaida 1.0,\" as created by bin Laden and led from his hideout in Pakistan. Olson said the group had already lost steam because of the revolts of the Arab Spring, which proved the Muslim world did not need al-Qaida to bring down governments, from Tunisia to Egypt. \"I think the death of bin Laden was an uppercut to the jaw,\" Olson told a packed crowd, opening the Aspen Security Forum. \"It just knocked them on their heels.\"\r\nhttp://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SPECIAL_OPERATIONS_AL_QAIDA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2011-07-28-02-24-09\r\n\r\nFort Hood Suspect Mentions al Qaeda Cleric Believed to Have Inspired Previous Attack\r\nABC News\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nA U.S. serviceman is in custody after he allegedly admitted he was planning an attack on his fellow servicemen at the U.S. Army base at Fort Hood, Texas, the same base where 13 people were killed in a 2009 terror attack. U.S. officials told ABC News an AWOL soldier, identified by the FBI as a Private First Class Naser Jason Abdo, was arrested Wednesday after making a purchase at Guns Galore in Killeen, Texas, the same ammunition store where Maj. Nidal Hasan purchased the weapons he allegedly used to gun down 13 people and wound 32 others on Nov. 5, 2009. According to one senior official, Abdo has also mentioned the name of high profile al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki -- the same man investigators said inspired the previous Fort Hood attack along with other potentially deadly terror plots in the U.S. -- though no direct link between Abdo and Awlaki has been found. Abdo, 21, allegedly told law enforcement he wanted to \"get even\" and was targeting Ft. Hood because of the previous attack there, according to law enforcement documents obtained by ABC News. The documents say he did not plan to attack the base itself, but instead planned to plant two bombs at a nearby restaurant popular with Ft. Hood personnel.\r\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/fort-hood-plot-awol-us-serviceman-arrested/story?id=14179096\r\n\r\nFBI says bomb-making materials found in motel room of AWOL soldier arrested near Fort Hood\r\nAssociated Press\r\nJuly 28, 2011\r\n\r\nKILLEEN, Texas \u2014 FBI says bomb-making materials found in motel room of AWOL soldier arrested near Fort Hood\r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fbi-says-bomb-making-materials-found-in-motel-room-of-awol-soldier-arrested-near-fort-hood/2011/07/28/gIQAZ8P4eI_story.html\r\n\r\nJudge: U.S. must show 'good cause' to revise anthrax filing\r\nMcClatchy Newspapers\r\nJuly 27, 2011\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge has blocked, at least temporarily, a Justice Department attempt to back away from court admissions that appeared to undercut previous FBI assertions that an Army researcher was responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks. In an order issued Monday, U.S. District Judge Daniel Hurley of West Palm Beach, Fla., said the government must \"show good cause\" before he will allow it to change the original filing, which lawyers for the department's Civil Division made in an 8-year-old case brought by the family of one of the five victims. That filing asserted that Bruce Ivins, who the FBI alleges manufactured the anthrax in his government lab, did not have access in the lab to the special equipment needed to make the deadly powder. The Justice Department wants to revise the filing to say that Ivins did have access to the equipment elsewhere at the U.S. Army bio-weapons facility in Frederick, Md., where he worked.\r\nhttp://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/07/27/118494/judge-says-us-must-show-good-cause.html\r\n\r\nAlan Watt: Oslo Gunman\u2019s Massacre, A Design Ritual of Mind Control\r\nThe Alex Jones Channel\r\nJuly 27, 2011\r\n\r\nAlex also talks with author, researcher and radio talk show host Alan Watt.

With the DHS anti-terror apparatus now turned inward, do American citizens face the same treatment? Martin Luther King Jr. wisely proclaimed \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d Murat Kurnaz, a German-born Turkish citizen, describes in the video below his chilling story of torture under United States custody. Kurnaz was rounded up in Pakistan at the height of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 when locals sold him to the U.S. military for $3000, the bounty paid to citizen spies for \u201cterror suspects.\u201d With the Department of Homeland Security ramping up its own citizen spy program, can we expect the same treatment in America? Working for a peaceful NGO, Kurnaz was detained on his way to return home to Germany. Over the next five years he was repeatedly tortured by the United States with no charges ever filed. According to Amnesty USA, \u201chis 2006 release was prompted by a personal plea by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to President George W. Bush even though official documents show that U.S. and German authorities had determined in 2002 that he was innocent.\u201d\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/citizen-spies-brutal-torture-foreshadow-the-domestic-war-on-terror\r\n\r\nNorway attacks: 'No proof of UK link to Breivik'\r\nBBC\r\nJuly 27, 2011\r\n\r\nNorway's domestic intelligence chief has told the BBC no proof has yet been found to link Anders Behring Breivik to right-wing extremists in the UK. Mr Breivik, who admits Friday's bomb and gun attacks which killed at least 76 people, has written of meeting such groups nine years ago. But intelligence chief Janne Kristiansen said she believed he had acted completely on his own. Norwegian police have begun releasing names of victims. They published four names, with more expected to follow later on Wednesday; others have been identified in Norwegian media. The bomb in the capital Oslo targeted buildings connected to Norway's Labour government, while the mass shooting occurred at an annual Labour youth camp on a small island, Utoeya. Mr Breivik has said he had wanted to inflict maximum damage on the party, which he accuses of failing the country on immigration, according to his lawyer. The massacre prompted up to a quarter of a million people to take to the streets of Oslo on Monday to commemorate the victims. A Norwegian cabinet minister, Administration and Church Affairs Minister Rigmor Aasrud, will make a symbolic return on Wednesday to her bomb-damaged office, Reuters news agency reports. 'Calculating and evil' \"I can tell you, at this moment in time, we don't have evidence or we don't have indications that he has been part of a broader movement or that he has been in connection with other cells or that there are other cells,\" said Ms Kristiansen, who heads the Norwegian Police Security Service.\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14303363\r\n\r\nIn global travel alert, US says bin Laden death raises risk of anti-American violence overseas\r\nAssociated Press\r\nJuly 26, 2011\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON - The Obama administration says Osama bin Laden's death has raised the risk of anti-American violence worldwide. The State Department said in a global travel warning Tuesday that Americans should take precaution and maintain vigilance about terrorist threats, demonstrations and the possibility of violence against U.S. citizens. It said al-Qaida and other groups are planning terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in Europe, Asia, Africa and Middle East. The department said attacks may be in the form of suicide operations, assassinations, kidnappings, hijackings and bombings. Americans should consider the potential for attacks on transportation systems and tourist infrastructure, it said. It noted such attacks in Moscow, London, Madrid, Glasgow and New York in recent years. The department also warned Americans to avoid demonstrations in the Arab world because they can turn violent.\r\nhttp://www.startribune.com/nation/126191453.html\r\n\r\nOperation \u201cCastaway: Second ATF Gun-Running Scandal Exposed in\u2026\u2026 Honduras\r\nDeadline Live\r\nJuly 26, 2011\r\n\r\nTwo reporters now claim there is a second version of \u201cFast and Furious\u201d \u2013 only the new one is called \u201cOperation Castaway\u201d.  Just like the first one, it\u2019s also being run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d) \u2013 but instead of being located in Phoenix,Arizona, it\u2019s now headquartered in Tampa, Florida.  And instead of walking guns into Mexico, this new version is walking illegal firearms into the Honduras!\r\nhttp://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2011/07/breaking-news-source-claims-atfs-tampa.html\r\nThough the guns procured in \u201cOperation Castaway\u201d were initially \u201cwalked\u201d to the Honduras, those weapons didn\u2019t stay there. Instead, they were \u201csmuggled through Honduras and other Central and South American countries before being used in violent crimes in Mexico and other countries in the region. A number of the firearms trafficked by the defendants in Operation Castaway have been linked to violent crimes around the world.\u201d This new version was reported on last September 2010 by Brian Albritton, the US Attorney for the Middle District of Florida. At that time, he proudly announced the assistance of Virginia O\u2019Brien, Special Agent in Charge of the central and northern Florida Bureau of ATF operations. Though Albritton may claim ignorance of what those guns were doing, poor old O\u2019Brien hasn\u2019t that luxury. You see, before she transferred to Florida, she first worked as an ATF agent in Phoenix, Arizona (you know, the city that ran \u201cFast and Furious\u201d). And by strange coincidence, her new city of Tampa, Florida is \u201cwalking\u201d guns to Honduras by using the \u201csame failed strategy as the Phoenix Field Division\u2019s\u201d. It gets worse. Apparently O\u2019Brien has left a trail of emails in which she evidently tried to cover up her deeds by advising others they didn\u2019t have to report their \u201cwalked guns\u201d on the technicality that Tampa Field Division isn\u2019t part of the Southwest Border or Project Gunrunner. Those emails could be a teensy problem; and, by golly, the \u201cfirst person source\u201d informing the reporters seems to agree. As that individual crudely phrases it, O\u2019Brien \u201cis sh*tting herself trying to cover it up.\u201d\r\nhttp://deadlinelive.info/2011/07/26/operation-\u201ccastaway-second-atf-gun-running-scandal-exposed-in\u2026\u2026-honduras\r\n\r\nBreivik's injected his dum-dum bullets with poison to make them deadlier\r\nDaily Mail\r\nJuly 26, 2011\r\n\r\nAnders Breivik could have used 'chemically enhanced' ammunition to ensure every shot was deadly, police believe.

Murray notes the fact Breivik posted comments on the blog of the American neocon and Islamophobe Pamela Geller. Breivik, we are told, hates Muslims, although we really don\u2019t know much about the alleged killer outside of what the Norwegian government has told us. His first court appearance was closed to the media. Next, Murray points out that Geller addressed the Tennessee Tea Party convention. \u201cGeller has been actively promoting links between the Tea Party and the English Defense League. Geller states on her website that she had been in Oslo to attend a pro-Israel rally. It would be interesting to know whether Anders Behring Breivik was also on that rally,\u201d Murray writes on his blog. \u201cWe are told that Behring Breivik acted alone.

Instead, he claimed those present were successful entrepreneurs, \u201cbusiness or political leaders, some with families, most Christian conservatives, but also some agnostics and even atheists\u201d. The gunman said that the participants of the meeting came from all over Europe and that he was first put into contact with them by a \u201cSerbian crusader commander\u201d. Breivik\u2019s conenctions with London \u2013 he lived there as a child when his father was working at the Norwegian embassy \u2013 are clearly a cornerstone of his plot. Indeed, as Mark Steyn writes for the National Review Online, the gunman\u2019s manifesto is largely concerned with Britain and America. \u201cThe entire document is strangely anglocentric \u2013 in among the citations of NR and The Washington Times, there\u2019s not a lot about Norway.\u201d The manifesto, signed by the killer as \u201cAndrew Berwick\u201d (an anglicised version of his name), is datelined \u201cLondon, 2011,\u201d clearly indicating Breivik was in the English capital before his rampage, although the media have asserted otherwise without expalining why Breivik would deliberately place such an error in his own screed.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/gunman-conspired-with-business-and-political-leaders-before-massacre\r\n\r\nAbsurd coverage of the Norwegian tragedy\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 26, 2011\r\n\r\nAs the days go by following the horrific slaughter at Utoya and the bombing in Oslo, the information has only become more confused and self-contradictory. The media began with the baseless conjecture that it was an al Qaeda-affiliated group behind the attacks. The only evidence presented was the fact that threats had been made against Norway in the past and of course the highly reliable source that is jihadist forums. Wired\u2019s Danger Room ran with a story that only proposed Muslim terrorists as the culprits. Despite the same amount of evidence pointing to other interests behind the attack, they decided to run with the Islamophobic current that is all-too-common in the Western world. I find it quite interesting that, before Breivik claimed responsibility, the perpetrators were being framed as terrorists. Suddenly, once it was established that the individual (or possibly individuals) responsible was a blond haired, blue-eyed Norwegian \u201cextremist\u201d. Why does he not get slapped with the terrorist label? How is this act of terror any different from every other? Does Breivik\u2019s ideological and religious leaning somehow exclude him from the label of terrorist?

He told public YLE radio that Finnish police previously enhanced their online surveillance after a 22-year-student gunned down 10 people at a vocational school in the central town of Kauhajoki in September 2008. The gunman in the Kauhajoki shooting, who also killed himself, had dropped hints about his plans before carrying out the attack, as in the Norwegian case, Lardot said.

Officials say Breivik claimed that he was just one of up to 80 \u201csolo martyr cells\u201d recruited throughout Western Europe who were ready to follow his example of trying to overthrow governments tolerant of Islam, according to the newspaper. The \u201cfar right\u201d and the \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d Breivik supposedly considers himself a successor to the medieval Knights Templar. He said he was recruited at a meeting in London in April 2002 hosted by two English extremists and attended by eight people. In his massive manifesto that lifts entire sections of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski\u2019s treatise against modern civilization, Breivik said he had communicated with the English Defense League. The EDL is at best a marginal political group consisting of around 300 dedicated members. It counters Muslim demonstrations against the occupation of Afghanistan, rallies against supporters of the Palestinian cause, and has clashed with socialists.\r\n\ufeffhttp://www.infowars.com/norway-killings-prompt-crackdown-on-brits-opposed-to-immigration\ufeff\r\n\r\nNorway Killer Warns Of \u201cTwo More Cells\u201d Preparing Attacks\r\nGunman reverses position, says he did not act alone\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 25, 2011\r\n\r\nAfter initially stating that he acted alone in carrying out Friday\u2019s massacre, Anders Behring Breivik has now suggested in court that two other \u201ccells\u201d of extremists collaborated with him.

During his Channel 4 News broadcast on Friday evening, host Jon Snow asked \u201cwhy police knew the killer\u2019s name by the time they had arrived on the island,\u201d reported the Telegraph live blog. \u201cHe surrendered the moment police called his name 3 minutes after they arrived. What we don\u2019t know is how the police knew the terrorist\u2019s name before they arrested him,\u201d said Snow, who is recognized as one of Britain\u2019s most trusted news anchors, and cannot be dismissed as a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d. Snow also posed the question on his official Twitter page. How authorities knew the gunman\u2019s identity before his slaughter of young Norwegians on the island of Utoeya had even come to an end, and while the overwhelming speculation still centered around Islamic terrorists, is a mystery, as is the question of why the cops didn\u2019t shoot Breivik immediately.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/police-knew-gunmans-name-before-arrest\r\n\r\nAnders Behring Breivik: Manufacturing a Patsy?\r\nTrusting media portrayal of gunman foolish given how press got it spectacularly wrong in blaming Muslims\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 25, 2011\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that the establishment media got it spectacularly wrong by instantly jumping to the conclusion that Friday\u2019s deadly attack in Norway was the work of Al-Qaeda Muslims, placing complete trust in the details emerging about gunman Anders Behring Breivik would be foolish, especially since there are innumerable inconsistencies and contradictions that need to be studied before a fuller picture of what motivated the bloodshed can be established. The rush to blame Muslims for the carnage, hastily parroted by an onslaught of mainstream \u201cterror experts,\u201d was a startling insight into how the propaganda that fuels the war on terror is so unquestionably bounced around the echo chamber of the corporate media. It\u2019s also a reminder that the mainstream press instantly falls in line with whoever the establishment designates the enemy du jour to be at any given time. Now that Muslims have been so vehemently demonized as terrorists, it\u2019s the turn of so called \u201cright-wing extremists,\u201d or anyone who disagrees with mass immigration, loss of sovereignty and globalist financial looting, to feel the heat. The effort to smear European conservatives as unhinged radicals who harbor simmering urges for bloodlust is now in full swing, and it\u2019s a demonization campaign firmly founded on the carefully crafted public portrayal of Anders Behring Breivik. However, it\u2019s quickly becoming apparent that just as many eyewitnesses reported two gunmen on the island where the rampage unfolded, there are two different personas behind Breivik himself. Indeed, there are two different Facebook profiles for Breivik, one from before the massacre and one from after. The latter profile appears to have been embellished and deliberately altered to emphasize the notion that the gunman was motivated by his \u201cChristian conservative\u201d beliefs.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/anders-behring-breivik-manufacturing-a-patsy\r\n\r\nAlex Jones & Webster Tarpley: Norway Terror Attacks a False Flag Staged Event\r\nThe Alex Jones Channel\r\nJuly 25, 2011\r\n\r\nAlex Jones & Webster Tarpley discuss early indications that the attacks in Norway are part of a wider plot.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/alex-jones-webster-tarpley-norway-terror-attacks-a-false-flag-staged-event\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the Oslo Attacks Part 3: More Information & Even More Unclear\r\nActivist Post\r\nJuly 25, 2011\r\n\r\nAfter Anders Behring Breivik claimed responsibility for the atrocious killing spree in Norway, and his manifesto was discovered and published, the facts we are presented with continue to be quite strange. First it was attributed to an al Qaeda affiliated group, then it was a lone Christian anti-Muslim self-declared pseudo-Knights Templar, and then it was announced there was a possible second gunman involved. To make matters murkier, much of his 1,500 page manifesto was directly lifted from the infamous Theodore Kaczynski, better known as \u201cthe Unabomber\u201d Nearly one dozen passages were directly copied from the Unabomber\u2019s manifesto without attribution and with the only changes being the exchanges of some words to match Breivik\u2019s rhetoric. This was discovered by some observant Norwegian bloggers and was utilized by the mainstream Western media not to question the validity and providence of Breivik\u2019s manifesto, but instead to reinforce the contrived Unabomber-Breivik connection.\r\nhttp://www.activistpost.com/2011/07/analyzing-oslo-attacks-part-three-more.html\r\n\r\nBreivik Wanted To Reform \u201cKnights Templar Europe\u201d\r\nLondon Guardian\r\nJuly 24, 2011\r\n\r\nThe video above was created by the gunman, Anders Behring Breivik. Anders Behring Breivik, the man behind the Norway killings that left 93 people dead, began his journey in extremist rightwing politics at a small meeting in London in 2002, according to his online manifesto, and may have attended a far right demonstration in the UK as recently as last year. In a 1,467-page document that contains chilling details of his preparations for Friday\u2019s attacks, Breivik outlines his UK links, claiming he met eight other extremists from across Europe in London in 2002 to \u201cre-form\u201d the Knights Templar Europe \u2013 a group whose purpose was \u201cto seize political and military control of western European countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda\u201d. The manifesto, signed \u201cAndrew Berwick London 2011\u2033, contains repeated references to his links to the UK far right group the English Defence League. On Sunday there were unconfirmed reports from one of the organisation\u2019s supporters that the 32-year-old had attended at least one EDL demonstration in the UK in 2010. In the manifesto titled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, Breivik writes: \u201cI used to have more than 600 EDL members as Facebook friends and have spoken with tens of EDL members and leaders. In fact; I was one of the individuals who supplied them with processed ideological material (including rhetorical strategies) in the very beginning.\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/24/norway-gunman-london-connection-edl\r\n\r\nNorway Terror Attacks a False Flag\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 24, 2011\r\n\r\nMore Than One Shooter on Island; Oslo Bomb Drill Just Concluded; Was It NATO\u2019s Revenge for Norway\u2019s Decision to Stop Bombing Libya?

It has also come to light that a special police unit had been conducting a drill or exercise in downtown Oslo which involved the detonation of bombs \u2013 exactly what caused the bloodshed a few hundred meters away little more than 48 hours later. Further research reveals that United States intelligence agencies had been conducting a large-scale program of recruiting retired Norwegian police officers with the alleged purpose of conducting surveillance inside the country.

Investigations conducted by the crime unit located at the Hague reveal that supposed \u201cultra-right\u201d groups pose little threat. Instead, the primary threat comes from anarchists and other leftist groups. In 2010, groups identified as leftist were responsible for 45 attacks, a 12 percent increase from the previous year. On several different occasions, anarchist groups have been shown to consist of police agents provocateurs. Government has a long track record of infiltrating leftist groups and agitating for political violence. As the Hal Turner case revealed, the government basically built the American National Socialist and white supremacist movements from the ground up. Although the FBI claimed decades ago to have abandoned its notorious COINTELPRO, evidence abounds indicating the program is still operational. \u201cThe numbers of rightwing extremist criminal offenses are relatively low,\u201d Europol said. The statement reveals that any such investigation is unwarranted and will be a witch hunt. Groups deemed \u201cfar right\u201d \u2013 in other words, opposed to an unelected European Union bureaucracy and its effort to force banker debt \u201crepayment\u201d and austerity measures across Europe \u2013 will be put under a microscope and demonized as terrorists.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/europol-to-investigate-non-islamic-terror\r\n\r\n\u201cWhite Al Qaeda\u201d targeted as western governments turn terror apparatus inward\r\nOld-Thinker News\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nPre-2008 market crash: Ministry of Defense report frames middle class as \u201crevolutionary,\u201d \u201c\u2026as the burden of acquired debt and the failure of pension provision begins to bite.\u201d The government narrative of the \u201cWhite Alqaeda\u201d threat has been ongoing for at least 3 years now. The latest bombing in Norway is continuing the saga. In a recent development, a report from USA Today reads, \u201cA police official tells the Associated Press that today\u2019s terror is more like the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center by Islamist fundamentalists.\u201d This event is feeding into a growing trend in which western governments are turning their anti-terror apparatus inward. The Department of Homeland Security recently released a video in which the depiction of terrorist activity involved white men in every threat scenario.Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano recently made clear that domestic terrorism is at the center of the government\u2019s focus. In the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, Time Magazine printed an article in which the government\u2019s post-bombing propaganda campaign is expressed vividly. The article stated in part that individuals like Timothy McVeigh \u201c\u2026drew on widespread mistrust and even hatred of government power\u2026 Their coalition included well-known elements of far-right thought: tax-protesters; Christian home-schoolers; conspiracy theorists influenced by the John Birch Society\u2019s fear of one-world government; Second Amendment activists for whom guns are an important part of an independent way of life; self-reliant types who resent a Federal Government\u2026\u201d Behind the smoke rising from Oslo the economic collapse of the European Union \u2013 and the world \u2013 is brewing in the background. Resistance to the banking takeover has entered into the government threat matrix and the international criminal profile is turning towards white middle class individuals. As Kurt Nimmo documents at Infowars.com, the Oslo bombing suspect was a member of the \u201clibertarian people\u2019s party\u201d, an equivalent of the Tea Party in the United States.\r\nhttp://www.oldthinkernews.com/?p=1944\r\n\r\nU.S Government Smuggled Missles, Grenades And Other Military Grade Weapons To Mexico Drug Cartels\r\nAlexander Higgins\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nThe U.S government weapons smuggling scandal grown from a simple gun smuggling scandal into a full blown military grade weapons smuggling scandal following the arrest of a Zetas cartel leader.

Several young people who survived Utoya's massacre, told VG paper that the shootings were coming from \"two different places on the island at the same time.\" \"I believe that there were two people who were shooting,\" VG quoted a 23-year old Alexander Stavdal.\r\nhttp://en.rian.ru/world/20110723/165350450.html\r\n\r\nEvidence Shows Norway Terror Attack a False Flag\r\nInfowars.com\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nPrior to the events in Norway, the Department of Homeland Security released a propaganda video characterizing white middle class Americans as terrorists and members of white al-Qaeda, a term designed to conflate the image of the CIA-created Islamic terror group and \u201crightwing extremists\u201d in America. The DHS video is part of the government\u2019s \u201cSee Something, Say Something\u201d mass hysteria campaign and follows its report leaked to the media in 2009 designating libertarians and Second Amendment advocates as terrorists and right-wing extremists. The alleged perpetrator in the Norway bombing and shooting is being described as a right-wing extremist who was a former member of a popular political party that regards itself to be a \u201clibertarian people\u2019s party\u201d with an ideology based on classical liberalism. Anders Behring Breivik was at one time a member of the Progress Party, according to news reports. He was a member from 2004 to 2006 and in its youth party from 1997-2006 through 2007. The Progress Party platform preamble identifies the organization as populist libertarian and its main declared goal as a reduction in taxes and government intervention. The CFR says the Progress Party and similar political parties in Sweden and Finland represent a European Tea Party movement on the rise. In the U.S., the Tea Party has opposed government bailouts to the banksters and has called for ending the Federal Reserve. The EU, the IMF and the international bankers are worried about growing populism in Europe. \u201cRising political populism around Europe, driven by public anger over the impact of the financial crisis, threatens to make solving the euro zone\u2019s debt woes increasingly difficult,\u201d Reuters reported in April. Millions of Europeans are opposed to raiding their treasuries to pay for debt contrived by the bankers and have turned in large numbers to political parties such as the True Finns. The True Finns\u2019 main campaign plank is opposition to funding a bailout for Portugal. In April, the Finnish party emerged from relative obscurity and moved into the political limelight. Its sudden popularity took the European establishment by surprise. The false flag attack in Norway arrives as populism grows in Germany, Europe\u2019s reluctant paymaster for the contrived debt-based economic crisis.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/evidence-shows-norway-terror-attack-a-false-flag\r\n\r\n\u2018Caution! Watch out for false flags\u2019 \u2013 Oslo attacks\r\nRussia Today\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nNorwegian police say at least 84 people have been killed in a shooting spree at a youth camp on the island of Utoya, near the capital Oslo. The attack came shortly after a powerful blast shook the government centre in downtown Oslo, claiming at least seven lives. A 32-year-old Norweigan man has been arrested in Norway, in connection with the dual attacks.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyi7_pKEXV8&feature=channel_video_title\r\n\r\nWas Norway Killer Anders Behring Breivik a Freemason?\r\nInfowars\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nFLASHBACK: Dunblane killer Thomas Hamilton was also a Freemason, police investigated claims of a \u201cMasonic conspiracy\u201d. PDF of Breivik\u2019s Facebook Page There is a pdf of Breivik\u2019s Facebook page hosted on Solid Principals Blog. (I\u2019ll host a local copy here as well.) Facebook was the source of the image on Daily Mail. Here is how how it appeared on Facebook. Some people are claiming this is a photoshop, but if it is then it must have been done by Breivik himself, because it was posted on his original Facebook and is now being used by mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail. Breivik also included Freemasons on his list of interests. According to this link, Breivik was with the Saint Johannes lodge in Oslo from at least 2008 onwards.\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/norway-killer-anders-behring-breivik-was-a-freemason\r\n\r\nEstablishment Media Rushed To Blame Madman Attack on Muslims With No Evidence\r\nZero Hedge\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nComment: Within barely an hour of the attack, the New York Times had blamed \u201cAl-Qaeda\u201d for an attack that turned out to be the work of a lone madman. Perhaps it is time for the Telegraph to issue a retraction to its kneejerk publication in which it automatically cast blame on Islamists and other \u201ceastern\u201d terrorists-by-default. Because according to just released info, they could not have been more wrong, and it is the reaction to precisely this type of prejudice that will never facilitate bridging frayed relations between disparate cultures. Anyway, so much for prejudiced speculation and/or lies about some Islamist organization taking the blame for the events in Norway today. Here is the truth:\u201d VG has received confirmation from several independent sources that it was Anders Behring Breivik, who was arrested by armed police after the mass killings of Ut\u00f8ya Friday. VG was also present when the emergency squad took action against the flat 32-year-old susceptible west of Oslo. Several foreign media have also named Breivik as the perpetrator.\u201d More on his motives: \u201cA childhood friend of Breivik says to VG Nett that he should have been right-wing in the late 20\u2032s, and posted a series of controversial opinions on Facebook.\u201d And the kicker, for all the bigots out there: he was an ultra nationalist who hated Islam. Today\u2019s tragic events were merely the outburst of deranged and very much troubled Loughner, McVey-like psychophath. And nothing more. And more: In online debates he makes his mark as a well-read, and one with strong opinions about Norwegian politics. He promotes a very conservative opinions, which he also called nationalist. He expresses himself strongly opposed to multiculturalism \u2013 that cultural differences can live together in a community. He has had many posts on the site Document.no, an Islam-critical site that publishes news and commentary.\r\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/article/single-white-norway-psychopath-killer-anders-behring-breivik-32-nationalist-hates-islam\r\n\r\nWhy Would a \u201cRight-Wing Nationalist\u201d Massacre Young, Predominantly White Norwegians?\r\nNorway Attacks Suspect \u2018Has Right-Wing Ties\u2019\r\nSky News\r\n July 23, 2011\r\n\r\nComment: Why would a \u201cright-wing extremist\u201d who calls himself a nationalist and hates Muslims choose to massacre scores of young, predominantly white, Norwegian youths? Why not attack a mosque? Police have said a Norwegian man arrested after the twin attacks in Norway is a right-winger with anti-Muslim views, but they do not know whether that was a factor in the attacks. Police are continuing to question the 32-year-old \u2013 named by Norwegian television as Anders Behring Breivik \u2013 after he was detained on Friday evening in connection with the attacks. National police chief Sveinung Sponheim said internet postings by the suspected gunman \u201csuggest that he has some political traits directed toward the right, and anti-Muslim views, but if that was a motivation for the actual act remains to be seen\u201d. Norway\u2019s TV2 channel claimed Breivik has links to \u201cright-wing extremists\u201d and possessed two weapons registered in his name.\r\nhttp://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Norway-Twin-Attacks-Suspect-Anders-Behring-Breivik-Is-A-Right-Winger-With-Anti-Muslim-Views/Article/201107416035936?lpos=World_News_Carousel_Region_1&lid=ARTICLE_16035936_Norway_Twin_Attacks%3A_Suspect_Anders_Behring_Breivik_Is_A_Right-Winger_With_Anti-Muslim_Views\r\n\r\n\ufeffNorway PM Was Due To Visit Massacre Camp\ufeff\r\nBBC News\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nMr Stoltenberg had been due to visit the camp on Saturday. Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store, who visited the camp on Thursday, praised those who were attending. \u201cThe country has no finer youth than young people who go for a summer camp doing politics, doing discussions, doing training, doing football, and then they experience this absolutely horrendous act of violence,\u201d he said. In Oslo, government officials urged people to stay at home and avoid central areas of the city.\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14259356\r\n\r\n91 Killed: Death Toll Rises Dramatically\r\nLondon Guardian\r\nJuly 23, 2011\r\n\r\nNorway was today coming to terms with one of the worst atrocities in recent European history as police revealed that 91 people died in the attacks in the centre of Oslo and on a nearby island summer camp, apparently the work of a lone gunman. The killings, it now seems clear, were carried out by a 32-year old Norwegian, named by local media as Anders Behring Breivik, who had expressed far-right views, and had dressed as a policeman to carry out his bomb attack on government buildings in central Oslo before heading to the island of Ut\u00f8ya, where he shot at least 84 people. Survivors of the island attack, which took place barely two hours after a huge bomb was detonated close to the offices of Norway\u2019s prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, described how the gunmen moved across the small, wooded Ut\u00f8ya holiday island on Friday firing at random as young people scattered in fear. Teenagers at the lakeside camp organised by Stoltenberg\u2019s ruling Labour party fled screaming in panic, many leaping into the water or climbing trees to save themselves, when the attacker began spraying them with gunfire.\r\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/23/norway-attacks\r\n\r\nMore on Norway\u2019s \u201cFalse Flag\u201d Attack (video)\r\nDeadline Live\r\nJuly 22, 2011\r\n\r\nMultiple Terrorist Bombings In Olso, Norway \u2014 Signature Of Mossad False Flag Al-Queda Terror Attack\r\nhttp://deadlinelive.info/2011/07/22/more-on-norways-false-flag-attack", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1757960}]
