Read it and weep:  \r\n\r\nNervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from monitors US Patent #6,506,148\r\n\r\n\u201cSUMMARY: Computer monitors and TV monitors can be made to emit weak low-frequency electromagnetic fields merely by pulsing the intensity of displayed images. Experiments have shown that the 1/2 Hz sensory resonance can be excited in this manner in a subject near the monitor. The 2.4 Hz sensory resonance can also be excited in this fashion. Hence, a TV monitor or computer monitor can be used to manipulate the nervous system of nearby people.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is thus apparent that the human nervous system can be manipulated by screen emissions from subliminal TV image pulses.\u201d LINK\r\n\r\nThe human nervous system controls everything from breathing and producing digestive enzymes, to memory and intelligence.
