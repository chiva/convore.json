Nonetheless, it gave the Idaho National Laboratory \u2014 which is part of the Energy Department, responsible for America\u2019s nuclear arms \u2014 the chance to identify well-hidden holes in the Siemens systems that were exploited the next year by Stuxnet.\r\n\r\nThe article goes on to say that while the U.S. and Britain had trouble getting their copies of the Dutch-Pakistani-designed P-1 centrifuges \u2014  the type used by Iran to enrich uranium \u2014 to work, the Israelis were able to do so. Their success allegedly opened the door for the U.S. to test Stuxnet on the types of equipment used at Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility.\r\n\r\nThe Idaho National Laboratory, which conducted the tests with the Siemens software, insist that the project was part of an overall effort to shore up U.S. cyber defenses against outsiders attempting to take control of nuclear equipment, not some effort aimed at figuring out how to sabotage Iran:\r\n\r\n    the Idaho National Laboratory confirmed that it formed a partnership with Siemens but said it was one of many with manufacturers to identify cybervulnerabilities. It argued that the report did not detail specific flaws that attackers could exploit. But it also said it could not comment on the laboratory\u2019s classified missions, leaving unanswered the question of whether it passed what it learned about the Siemens systems to other parts of the nation\u2019s intelligence apparatus.\r\n\r\nStill, it seems like one heck of a coincidence that the U.S. government was working to discover weaknesses with the very industrial control system that was successfully targeted by what has been called one of the most sophisticated cyber weapons ever used.\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2011/01/20/more-clues-to-stuxnets-origin", "group_id": 3920, "id": 116636}]
