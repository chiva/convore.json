However, protesters cried foul, claiming that Walker was invoking the Guard as an intimidation tactic to suppress dissent.\r\n\r\n\u201cHundreds of Wisconsin National Guard soldiers return to the state Friday,\u201d reports the Wausau Daily Herald.\r\n\r\n\u201cAbout 300 soldiers from the 724th Engineer Battalion will be back at Volk Field where they will be met by senior National Guard officials and family members. A brief ceremony will be held before the soldiers are taken to nearby Fort McCoy to begin about five days of demobilization before their release.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe unit comprises roughly half of Wisconsin\u2019s National Guard soldiers that are currently on active duty. They return fresh from Iraq after having been on missions to remove roadside bombs placed by insurgents.\r\n\r\nThey may now face a different type of insurgency, one led by state workers who are furious that their pension and health care contributions are set to double to fill a $3.6 billion budget deficit black hole, while two-thirds of corporations in the state pay no taxes whatsoever according to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.\r\n\r\nThe sight of fully uniformed National Guard soldiers policing angry Americans could see a repeat of the scenes witnessed in Cairo over the last few weeks. Indeed, Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan (R) is already drawing similar comparisons.\r\n\r\nRyan expressed his opposition to the demands of the protesters, pointing out that even after Walker\u2019s bill is passed, state sector workers would still pay far less in pension and health contributions that private sector workers, but noted that the level of fury surrounding the legislation meant that Walker was now facing, \u201cRiots \u2014 it\u2019s like Cairo has moved to Madison these days.\u201d\r\n\r\nMaking reference to Walker\u2019s threat to bring in the National Guard, liberal activist and author Noam Chomsky told Democracy Now that what happened in Egypt was \u201cthe beginning of what we need here \u2013 democracy uprising.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome have even expressed fears that the Guard could be used to break the strikes at the point of a gun. Such a move would not be without historical precedent.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe last time Wisconsin called in the National Guard was in 1886. The Guard, then called the State Militia were brought in to break a rally of Milwaukee workers advocating an 8-hour work day. The militia fired into a crowd of unarmed picketers; it\u2019s estimated that 5 to 7 workers were killed,\u201d reports the Huffington Post.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe the new governor doesn\u2019t understand yet \u2013 but the National Guard is not his own personal intimidation force to be mobilized to quash political dissent,\u201d said Robin Eckstein, a former Wisconsin National Guard member, Iraq War Veteran from Appleton, WI, and member of VoteVets.org. \u201cThe Guard is to be used in case of true emergencies and disasters, to help the people of Wisconsin, not to bully political opponents.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttp://www.infowars.com/returning-national-guard-troops-set-to-smash-wisconsin-protest", "group_id": 3920, "id": 148201}]
