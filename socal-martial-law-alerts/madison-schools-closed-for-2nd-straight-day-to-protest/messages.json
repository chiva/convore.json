(WTAQ) - Schools in Madison are closed for a second straight day, as teachers continue to protest the Republican effort to end most of their collective bargaining rights.\r\n\r\nAnd at least a dozen other school districts around Wisconsin\u2019s capital decide to close, after the head of the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union called on all 98,000 members to drive to Madison Thursday for protest rallies.\r\n\r\nAt a news conference Wednesday night, Mary Bell said, \u201cThis is not about protecting our pay and our benefits \u2013 It is about protecting our right to collectively bargain.\u201d But later, Bell stopped short of endorsing a coordinated teacher walkout. She asked teachers who could be at rally to do so.\r\n\r\nIn Milwaukee, Superintendent Greg Thornton said teachers are expected to be at work Thursday and Friday. And they\u2019ll be disciplined if they don\u2019t have valid excuses.\r\n\r\nGovernor Scott Walker said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the Madison teachers for being out Wednesday. He said he respects the workers\u2019 right to demonstrate but he\u2019s, \u201cnot intimidated into think that they\u2019re the only voices out there.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Education Action Group condemned the Madison walkout, saying the teachers\u2019 union cares more about politics than students. State officials said 10,000 people attended Wednesday\u2019s protest rally, which also called on Walker to resign.\r\n\r\nMadison Police gave a crowd estimate of 20,000. Students in parts of the state also continued their own walkouts. About 600 students at Madison West High School marched from a west side shopping center to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nhttp://whbl.com/news/articles/2011/feb/17/madison-schools-closed-2nd-straight-day-protest", "group_id": 3920, "id": 147521}]
