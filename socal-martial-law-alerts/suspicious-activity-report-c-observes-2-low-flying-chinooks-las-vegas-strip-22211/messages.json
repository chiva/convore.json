This was between Flamingo Road and Tropicana Blvd. I was on Maryland Parkway, across from the University of Nevada. The Helicopters flew directly toward the Strip. This is an area where I have lived and frequented for years and very rarely ever saw military helicopters flying this low toward Las Vegas Blvd. Oddly most people went about their business without ever looking up. There has been no mention of this in the local media.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.meetup.com/socalmartiallawalerts/messages/boards/thread/10483557", "group_id": 3920, "id": 195235}]
