Ten more RC-12Xs will be delivered between 2011 and 2012 and are set to stay in service through 2025.\r\n\r\nApparently, the first four planes will be tested and fully outfitted in theater, a move that could reflects the urgency that military officials associate with getting these prop-driven airplanes into combat. Many have described the Air Force MC-12s as invaluable; a sort of manned UAV that can fly above a patrol, warning the troops, some of whom they\u2019ve built a rapport with at their bases, in real time of approaching threats. The MC-12s Liberties were famously pushed into combat with incredible speed compared to most modern weapons programs.\r\n\r\nThe Army planes are used to sniff out and triangulate enemy communications and the like.\r\n\r\nFrom a Northrop announcement:\r\n\r\n    The RC-12X Guardrail Modernization program extends the life of the aircraft through 2025 and introduces new payloads to the system with enhanced capabilities to sense and exploit emerging and rapidly evolving irregular and conventional warfare threats. The program also enhances the sustainability of the RC-12X through commonality, a new glass cockpit, structural upgrades, and significant hardware and software improvements.\r\n\r\n    \u201cThe RC-12X will bring unprecedented SIGINT capability to the warfighter,\u201d said Trip Carter, director for Northrop Grumman\u2019s Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AISR) initiatives. \u201cWe are excited with this latest step toward making this a reality for their missions and are eager to continue to work with the Army to make the system operational as soon as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt adds that:\r\n\r\n    The RC-12X Guardrail is the Army\u2019s premier airborne SIGINT sensor and ground processing system, providing instantaneous precision geo-location and identification of threats to enable the Brigade Combat Team\u2019s Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze and Disseminate (F3EAD) battle command process.\r\n\r\nSometimes its the cheap, easy-to-field technology that can make a huge difference in a fight.\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2011/02/08/first-rc-12x-sigint-spy-planes-making-their-way-downrange", "group_id": 3920, "id": 118254}, {"user_id": 11626, "stars": [], "topic_id": 6307, "date_created": 1297844945.3317161, "message": "More vintage planes to be on the lookout for...", "group_id": 3920, "id": 118257}]
