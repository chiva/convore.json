(Note: the latter  officially disbanded just a week ago).  \u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nBut Bailey emphasized that she was never really a member of either group. Rather, Bailey claimed, she became close to Anonymous via her involvement with CrowdLeaks, a WikiLeaks related news site. \r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the FBI concluded its \"interview\" with the 29-year-old by seizing two hard drives, a camera and other electronic equipment.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tgdaily.com/security-features/56947-fbi-drops-by-for-a-chat-over-anon-links", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1536519}]
