The redirected traffic was said to include information from \u201cU.S. military, civilian organizations and that of U.S. allies. \u201d\r\n\r\nWhat has increased the concern over this incident is the fact that China\u2019s state-controlled telecommunications provider was able to handle this massive amount of traffic/data and continue to retransmit it back out again without anyone having a noticeable slow-down or disruption in the service. Some security experts point out that encryption could not have ensured the integrity of the redirected data.\r\n\r\nThis is believed to be the first time that the severity of this incident has been publicly discussed. What will the response by U.S. and other world leaders. One thing is for certain, this is one cyber event worth following closely!\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2010/11/16/15-percent-of-all-internet-traffic-secretly-rerouted-through-china", "group_id": 3920, "id": 116165}]
