I am unfamiliar with aircraft so I do not know what is was (possibly a Flying Fortress of a Stealth with lights only on the right front 'side of the triangle'((Not a Triangle UFO)))...while noticing aircraft noises much deeper and louder than usual I stepped outside and observed [the craft] flying and an extremely low altitude and being flanked/escorted by at least 3 regular military jets. it's speed seemed normal for what I am used to the jets doing and after it was gone I notice a strong pungent odor permeating the air. After a few minutes the smell abated and the air returned to normal. There either seems to something happening at the base or I just got a lucky show. Either way its abnormality caused me to report it.", "group_id": 3920, "id": 822392}]
