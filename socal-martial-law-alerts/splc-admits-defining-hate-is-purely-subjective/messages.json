Detailed information is collected & kept in files or turned over to police to help facilitate lawsuits & prosecutions\u2014 even prison sentences.\"\r\n\r\n\"AFP had the chance recently to interview Mark Potok, the spokesperson for Morris Dees\u2019s Southern Poverty Law Center, a multi-million-dollar operation that sees itself as America\u2019s premier civil rights organization, but more broadly exists to pigeonhole Americans into subjective categories of 'hate.'\u201d\r\n\r\n\"Potok, director of the SPLC's 'Intelligence Project,' tasked with monitoring 'hate groups' & 'extremists,' freely admitted to AFP that the method SPLC staffers use for determining 'hate' is not at all a science.\"\r\n\r\n\"This admission... could be seen as alarming. A subjective, therefore inaccurate 'hate' judgment from Potok & company at the SPLC could ruin someone\u2019s life or even become a jail sentence...\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.americanfreepress.net/html/splc_hate_253.html", "group_id": 3920, "id": 245661}]
