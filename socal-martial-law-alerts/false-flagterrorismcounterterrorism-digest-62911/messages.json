Hague's comments came a day after Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said they had fired 14 missiles in an exercise, one of them a medium-range weapon capable of striking Israel or US targets in the Gulf. In a statement to lawmakers, Hague said: \"Iran has also been carrying out covert ballistic missile tests and rocket launches, including testing missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload in contravention of UN resolution 1929.\" He said Iran had also announced plans to triple its capacity to produce 20 percent enriched uranium, adding: \"These are enrichment levels far greater than is needed for peaceful nuclear energy.\nhttp://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hnl-YPuDmONcoBmmS8_G91LxdryA?docId=CNG.041943dc452c61a507ee986061b49f2d.f21\n\nDHS Secretary Napolitano launches Faces of Homeland Security: Heroes on the Front Lines\nDHS\nJune 29, 2011\n\nOur guiding principle here at DHS is that homeland security begins with hometown security.

U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Lee ruled last week that the former CIA operative, who wrote and was sued by the government under the pseudonym Ishmael Jones, breached the agreement that requires agency personnel to seek pre-publication review of books and articles. In the next phase of the case, Lee will decide what monetary damages or other relief the CIA is entitled to. The book Jones published in 2008, \"The Human Factor:  Inside the CIA's Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture,\" is harsh toward what the former deep-cover officer who worked on nuclear proliferation issues considered widespread mismanagement at the spy agency.\nhttp://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0611/CIA_wins_suit_against_exofficer_who_published_unapproved_book.html\n\nActually, Special-Ops \u2018Night Raids\u2019 Are Rather Gentle\nWired's Danger Room\nJune 28, 2011\n\nAccording to Vice Adm.
