The plant functioned as designed, he said.\n\nThe plant remained in \u201chot shutdown\u201d mode this afternoon.\n\nFederal Nuclear Regulatory Commission resident inspectors assigned to the Salem site responded to Salem 2 and verified that the plant was stable and operator actions were consistent with procedures and that appropriate troubleshooting was being performed by PSEG Nuclear, according to NRC Spokesman Neil Sheehan.\n\nThe shutdown will count as a hit on the plant\u2019s performance indicator for unplanned shutdowns per 7,000 hours of online operations, according to Sheehan. If a plant experiences more than three unplanned shutdowns during the previous 7,000 hours of operation, it will receive additional NRC oversight.\n\n \u201cThis event shows why we need to have independent reviews of nuclear power plants and these plants need additional backup systems,\u201d said New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel.\n\nSalem 2 is one of three reactors operated by PSEG Nuclear at its generating site on Artificial Island here.\n\nMeanwhile, Salem Unit 1 and Hope Creek plants continue to operate at full power.\n\nAt full power the three plants provide enough electricity to supply three million homes.\n\nhttp://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2011/06/sakem_unit_2_nuclear_reactor_s.html", "group_id": 3920, "id": 1522654}]
