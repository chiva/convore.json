The latest demonstration saw the drone fly into and out of a building at 11mph, and withstand 5mph winds for the eight minute flight\r\n\r\nMatt Keennon, AeroVironment\u2019s manager on the project, said the milestone of building a machine inspired by nature pushes the limits of aerodynamics.\r\n\r\nHe added: \u2018This is a new form of man-made flight\u2019.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago the company showed off its first Hummingbird prototype, managing just 20 seconds. The latest flight lasted eight minutes, with engineers expecting longer flights as development continues.\r\n\r\nAeroVironment already produces a number of different drones for the US Army.\r\n\r\nLast year it had 2,182 orders from the army for its Raven drone, which weighs four pounds with a wingspan of four-and-a-half feet.\r\n \r\nCurrent drones, like the $30million Global Observer, pictured, are shaped like planes - but the new hummingbird creation is aimed at going unnoticed behind enemy lines\r\n\r\nAround 86 per cent of its orders come from the Government, meaning last year it was paid a whopping $215million from the Department of Defense.\r\n\r\nThe company, based in California with 732 full-time employees, expects to sell even more drones to the Government once rules are relaxed to allow spying within America.\r\n\r\nThe unveiling of the Hummingbird comes just weeks after the same company launched its $30million Global Observer with a wingspan similar to a Boeing 747 which can survey an area as large as Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nChris Fisher, project manager at AeroVironment explained: \u2018It gives the guy on the ground the opportunity to see what\u2019s on the other side of the hill.  There\u2019s only so much you can see with binoculars.  A small [drone] can get up and go over the hill. That gives the ground soldier a capability that is huge.\r\n\r\nHe added: \u2018One of the things we benefit from is the average young person in the military has hours and hours of video games experience. They are attuned to holding these things in their hands; moving the joysticks around with their thumbs and that\u2019s how our planes are flown. To an 18-year-old it\u2019s extremely simple.\u2019\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1358078/Is-bird-Is-plane-No-armys-latest-4million-spy-drone-disguised-hummingbird-measuring-just-16-centimetres.html", "group_id": 3920, "id": 149123}]
