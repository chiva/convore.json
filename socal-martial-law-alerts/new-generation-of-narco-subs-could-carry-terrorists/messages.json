It may even be able to travel at five knots while submerged and carry seven tons or roughly $100 million worth of cocaine.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a UPI write through on the story.\r\n\r\nhttp://defensetech.org/2011/02/08/new-generation-of-narco-subs-could-carry-terrorists", "group_id": 3920, "id": 116905}]
