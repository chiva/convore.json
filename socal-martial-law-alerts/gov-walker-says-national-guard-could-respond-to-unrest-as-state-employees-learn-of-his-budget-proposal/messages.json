Scott Walker says he is confident state workers will continue to show up for work and do their jobs, despite their potential disappointment in his emergency budget proposal.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there is worker unrest, Walker says the Wisconsin National Guard is prepared to respond.\r\n\r\nThe governor revealed Friday that he wants the state Legislature to go into Special Session next week to take up his plan to close a budget deficit. His plan calls for workers to lose nearly all their collective bargaining rights. State employees also would be required to pay more for pension and health care benefits.\r\n\r\nWalker first shared his plan with fellow Republican lawmakers in a closed-door meeting Thursday. He\u2019s talking more about his proposal Friday.\r\n\r\nThe governor says he\u2019s briefed the National Guard and other state agencies, to prepare them for any problems with workers, as they learn of Walker\u2019s emergency budget plan.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wuwm.com/programs/news/view_news.php?articleid=7765", "group_id": 3920, "id": 118519}]
