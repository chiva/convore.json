Even if targetting Python 2.3 was reasonable, so many things about DIP seem less than ideal to me. When I open up to Chapter 2 (1 was just about installation and such), Pilgrim lives up to his promise and dives in with a promise to explain. I look at the example and am baffled by several little things. The docstrings language is impresise and indicative of bad practice. There's several PEP8 violations\u2014spaces omitted where they should be and heinous, unnecessary use of backslash continuations, others... It strikes me as odd that list comprehensions are to be introduced before for loops. \nWhat of Pilgrim's promise to explain? The next section is 2.2 Declaring Functions, despite the fact Python doesn't have such a thing. I learn all sorts of things that aren't actually true\u2014\"Python figures out what type a variable is\" which isn't true and helps enforce ideas of what a variable is that prove problematic to many beginners. \nThen I turn the page to apply my knowledge and look for the exercises only to find there are none. It is difficult enough to get learners to do exercises when present and when absent it seems like very few learners will be proactive enough to come up with some.\nAs I go through the rest of the chapter and the rest of the book, I find time after time where I'm dissatisfied.
