Usually (in a non-GUI app) I would invoke set_trace() and simply inspect local objects. It doesn't work in PyQt4. After googling some docs I tried to use set_trace with pyqtRemoveInputHook() but still it's unusable. Putting a trace before app.exec_() prevents app from showing windows etc., putting it afterwards is meaningless because app either is working at GUI thread or already has stopped running.", "group_id": 292, "id": 436513}, {"user_id": 8291, "stars": [], "topic_id": 15181, "date_created": 1301038770.270257, "message": "Is there any way to debug my apps so easily as in pure C++/PyQt4 (by putting breaks/set_trace's everywhere I want) ?", "group_id": 292, "id": 436516}, {"user_id": 17897, "stars": [], "topic_id": 15181, "date_created": 1301041780.831744, "message": "use WingIDE.
