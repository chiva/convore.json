With Visual Leak Detector (VLD) I found memory leaks in it with simple tutorial examples. Even documentation says that through that routine CPython is not releasing all memory/objects. Maybe that's fine, but until I have more knowledge what objects are left in memory I don't feel I have control. Is there any simple way I can enumerate those objects through CPython native APIs? How to deal with embedding Python when during runtime you have many stateless scripts to run in isolation. Each should have clean environment set before running so initial thinking suggests Py_Initialize/Py_Finalize calls between each execution.. but this makes leaks \"by design\", I need better suggestions, anybody can help?", "group_id": 292, "id": 1130346}]
