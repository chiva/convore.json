I think over the coming year Python 3 will start to take off, and will be on a major upward trend by this time next year. So by the time you know the language well, you'll have no trouble finding places to make use of it (if nothing else, you can help get some slowpokes to port their modules from 2.x). Further, Python 2.x isn't going to look completely foreign to you if you know 3.x, so why learn the older one only to be forced to break all these brand new and (by py3k standards) bad habits? Also, a Python 1.5 script of any complexity is probably not going to run unmodified in Python 2.7, and the changes between 2.7->3 are a lot less drastic from, say, 2.3. In my experience, moving from 2.6->2.7 involves some minor tweaks, and moving from 2.7->3 involves some minor tweaks. You don't have to care about much of it if you just learn Python 3 now. A year ago I might've spoken differently, but in early 2011, I think starting out with Python 3 is just fine. There are several Python 3 books available on the shelves today, and plenty more coming.
