In this way you are not disappointed. For example I had never watched the popular TV show \"24\" and when I noticed it was available on Netflix streaming I added it to my instant que and loved it. I also like documentaries and watched Ken Burn's Civil War and liked it so I also watched his \"Baseball\" and I'm now watching his National Parks.\n\nThen there are new titles just added like Salt starring Angelina Jolie.\n\nI cancelled my cable TV two years ago and have never looked back!", "group_id": 9242, "id": 936468}]
