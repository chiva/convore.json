Even the best contracts may be worthless if their performance can not be legally enforced, just like due pecuniary claims need to be enforced. Regulations which standardize the conditions and procedures of the enforcement of legal claims are to be found in the procedural law of Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Law. \n\nWe help you in asserting your claims, advise you on how to protect your interests and represent you before the courts as well as before the Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Office. \n\nWe regularly advise companies, banks and financial institutions in the process of collection of their credits, secured or unsecured. In urgent cases, we assist in applying for immediate protection of their interests, for example through attachment. \n\nOur lawyers also help companies in financial difficulty through a reorganization process, bankruptcy or composition with creditors. This part of our activity may also include advice to the concerned company's directors and officers. \n\nOur expertise extends to international situations, for example if enforcement of foreign insolvency proceedings are necessary in Turkey.", "group_id": 4327, "id": 131184}]
