I recently switched carriers (T-Mobile to Sprint) and got an Evo. While I really like Android, the battery life killed me. I would generally only make it about 5 hours on my Evo before I was scrambling for the charger, and most of my battery use was sucked up by the OS itself, so I went back to a BlackBerry.
