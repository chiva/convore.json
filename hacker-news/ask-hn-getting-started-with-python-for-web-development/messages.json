Lately I have been trying to teach myself to teach programing language.\nThe only prior experience I have is a bit of C, just enough Php to get through to make WP themes from scratch and just finished the MIT OCW 6.0 along with the book How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.\n\nAlso I know basic MySQL, thanks to my job as an Analyst for over a year.\n\nNow I would like to get started with exposing myself to the part of building apps even if they are the most basic ones. Where should I begin with Web development using Python? (I know Php should have been the logical choice but I am just in love with Python for some reason; seems just right to me than C or Php)\n\nA point to note is that I am highly inclined for Pylons framework over Django because a project on which I want to work on later with other serious/experienced programmers requires it due to its sheer scale. I do not expect to be doing the same level of coding as them but at least I can help them when I am done with the design and UX part of the app.\n\nShould I go for a basic thing like web.py and learn the building blocks or choose Pylons?
