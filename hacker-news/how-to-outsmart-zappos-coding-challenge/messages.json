You were given a map, a 5x5 array where each square contained a set of directions, and the question was to find the starting point which eventually leads to a square with a treasure on it. The typical way of solving these problems (apparently) is a breadth-first algorithm, but the next day after failing the challenge, I figured out there was a much fast O(n) way of getting the answer! I wrote a short story of how it's done, including a sample code in Ruby. Check it out -- http://impulse.kirillzubovsky.com/post/4201509238/zappos-challenge ", "group_id": 95, "id": 487380}]
