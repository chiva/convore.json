Why not go with the same color scheme and a slightly smaller header section like on the main site. I like the simplicity of adding events. It'd be nice if the action icons on each event were a lot bigger because right now they're too small and too close together for me. IMO, there's too many priority colors that are very similar. Why not go with a smaller number of more distinct colors? Finally, the important sorting doesn't work for me. I have several events prioritized at different levels, yet they don't show up.
