I've put together this app, TipToe, after being fully pissed at Google for 1) letting a Chinese hacker brute force my gmail, and 2) following my steps after a search. So, this one is a search aggregator based on Bing and Blekko, works well for quick search on the iPhone. It fully respects your privacy, and lets you share your links on twitter, bookmark to instapaper, etc. I'll be getting Convore posting on it if people are interested. Actually, the plan is to add the class needed in ShareKit to do so. Hope you guys enjoy it, and that it's useful to you.", "group_id": 95, "id": 516062}]
