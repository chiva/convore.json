It also doesn't matter how many alarms I set, or where in the room/house I place them, I will aggressively turn them off and go back to sleep. \n\nIt has definitely helped me try to find the optimal amount of sleep I need *if* I can wake up at the right time. They've got a nice analytics page that shows you the different phases of sleep you were in during the night and also tries to generate a score for you. I haven't been using it long enough to know what effect different states I go to sleep in (drunk, really drunk) change that, though. \n\nIt is nice to not be woken up out of a deep sleep, and I think that helps, but other (cheaper) alternatives (EasyWakeup on the iPhone) have worked as well for that, they just haven't given me the comprehensive breakdown on my sleep stats.\n\nThey are adding some snooze functionality soon, so maybe that will help.
