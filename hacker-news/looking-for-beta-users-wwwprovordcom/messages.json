Provord allows you to virtualise that history preserving it.  Provord also allows you to add new media to that history such as videos, digital images etc making it richer.  Why shouldn't the history of a musical instrument include a video of it being played in concert for example, or all the digital photos taken of your car form a permanent part of its record.  Next you can then use the history to your advantage, for example when you look to sell your object, make it's history available to others to help you in that process. The driver for all of this this is the fact that history creates value.  If you go and look at 2 pieces of of antique furniture or 2 classic cars etc and one can demonstrate where it came from and what has been done to it and the other cannot.
