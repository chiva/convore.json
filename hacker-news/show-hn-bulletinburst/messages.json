It's a lean online press office, where companies can post their latest press releases or news together with 140 character max titles, which will be listed on the main page by latest as well as by category.\n\nThe vision is to cut out the barrage of spam that feature journalists get in the mailboxes by offering them a portal (with RSS feeds) to access releases from (or at least be one of the options).
