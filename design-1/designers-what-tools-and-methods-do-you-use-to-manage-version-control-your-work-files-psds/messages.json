See other threads in this group where similar issues were discussed by me. Our software guys were happy with GIT/SVN as these systems are really meant for source code with complex features like branching & branch management. At our company we have large Psd files for print - over 2GB and needed a system that could scale. We looked at everything out there and Evolphin Zoom was the better fit for us for 1) collaboration 2) lock management 3) performance & scalability 4) ease of use 5) Adobe CS integration 6) Mac Finder plugin. In future we are looking at automating our company's workflow and we liked their roadmap w.r.t marrying DAM with versioning and automated reviews.", "group_id": 629, "id": 1752002}]
