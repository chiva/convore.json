It sits like a jewel in my mind. The performances are ripping good. Of course Nicole Kidman, but Aaron Eckhart surprised me - he more than held his own with Kidman, and he should have gotten an oscar nomination for best actor. This would not - and probably should not - be up for best picture because it is simply so sad.
