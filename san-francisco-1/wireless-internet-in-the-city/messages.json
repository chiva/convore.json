But if you are not into overpaying for cellphone roaming charges, you should get an MiFi or similar and use Google Voice, Twilio or Skype for calls.

If you have a wifi portable device (in my case, an iPod Touch) it's a great way to find free WiFi. Walk around a block in any direction around SF, you'll find a couple dozen hotspots. Quick enough for checking email and that sort of thing. Obviously, cafes are your best bet and some cafes dont have plugs on purpose so as to deter long term users or just that it's a super popular cafe.", "group_id": 614, "id": 301953}]
