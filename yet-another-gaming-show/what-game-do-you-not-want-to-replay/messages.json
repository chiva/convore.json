I love that game and remember it being really funny when I played it as a kid, but I am afraid that nostalgia will be a bitch if I play it again.\n\nI recently went back and started playing Lunar again. The last time I played it was on SegaCD, back in like 1995... When I played it the first time I easily spent 90+ hours on it, and going back I had to punch out after 3 hours. The gameplay was so tedious, I decided it would be better to preserve the pleasant memories of playing it instead of letting them be ruined by the actual game.", "group_id": 1948, "id": 1181561}, {"user_id": 6014, "stars": [], "topic_id": 36779, "date_created": 1306346315.628377, "message": "If there's anything approaching a story, I have no interest in replaying a game.", "group_id": 1948, "id": 1181626}, {"user_id": 32096, "stars": [], "topic_id": 36779, "date_created": 1306345854.1826789, "message": "Not because the game was bad, but because you are afraid that the game won't live up to the memory you have", "group_id": 1948, "id": 1181515}]
