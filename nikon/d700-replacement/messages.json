Right now I'm using my D300 and my GF1, if I could replace that with Nikon's range of lenses and with the size of my GF1 and the power of the D300 with added GPS Functionality, I'd be a happy camper. :)", "group_id": 5591, "id": 276085}, {"user_id": 18134, "stars": [], "topic_id": 10823, "date_created": 1299325609.5408881, "message": "Built in GPS would be great; I have a feeling that with their new EVIL line that is coming out they'll integrate it.", "group_id": 5591, "id": 276065}]
