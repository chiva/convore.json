Thank you for responding, I was indeed curious whether you agreed with Mike. That's interesting about the types of openings. I wanted the opening to be an atmospheric type which pulls the viewer into the story world. Something like the beginning of Titanic (excluding the frame of the interview with the old woman). I really want the audience to immediately find out about the two races uneasily trying to work together on a barely livable planet; the audience needs to feel that tension even before they meet the MC, because he does not embody that tension, he is a contrast to it because he is a point of calm within the uneasy social environment.\n\nI let the program choose that because whether the main character is change or steadfast is relatively easy for me to ignore or change in exported reports or the Instant Dramatica applet. As you say, it's also something I usually know from the beginning, so I don't need the program to help me with that part. On the other hand something like the plot progression is impossible to change if I want to make any use of the PSR at all.

How can you have a proper storyform with out the basic dynamics correct? Here is a quote from Chris Huntley, \"CHARACTER: The four questions about character are about their character dynamics. Dynamics are about the relationships between things, not the things themselves. Most people do not make that distinction when thinking about structure, but it is one I think worth making. Think of dynamics as the story points that affect the flow of a story.\n\nPLOT: The same is true with the four plot dynamics questions.\n\nTHEME: The four thematic OS story points are, in fact, structural questions. Of the four, the OS Issue is the most \"theme\"-related topic.\n\nGENRE: The OS Domain (throughline) story point is the most genre-related question of the twelve essential questions. While we do not ask about the genre aspect of the OS Domain, it is directly connected to the type of Dramatica genre the story will have, e.g. Situation Comedy (Situation), Physical Comedy (Activity), Comedy of Manners (Fixed Attitude), or Comedy of Errors (Manipulation).\" http://forums.screenplay.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=4242#p8271", "group_id": 2515, "id": 2308567}, {"user_id": 36525, "stars": [], "topic_id": 46218, "date_created": 1318124939.5996909, "message": "@sam_potter Typically the combination of dynamics and thematics I want is not possible to have within the Dramatica program.  Possibly I do not think with the western paradigm Dramatica is intended for.  In this case any storyform would be wrong somewhere, so there is no proper story form for that story concept.  I've adapted by trying to make sure the wrongness is pushed into the areas where it will be least crippling, and I've also adapted by using more than one storyform so I can get everything right somewhere.  I agree that Dramatica's Dynamics express relationships between things.  Relationships are one of the things that come most easily to me as a writer, so they are something that I feel confident that if I get it wrong in Dramatica I can fix it later.  On the other hand plot sequence and putting the thematics into that plot sequence are difficult for me and what I want to use Dramatica to help me with.
