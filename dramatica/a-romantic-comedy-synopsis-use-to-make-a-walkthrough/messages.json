MC/IC Manipulation: The MC wears the costume specifically to manipulate how the IC reacts to her.  The contemplation in the story is primarily the MC evaluating her actions toward the IC and evaluating how she would feel in different possible versions of a relationship with the IC or lack of a relationship with him; also the IC reevaluates his desire to avoid children the the context of his relationship with the MC.  Any memories involved are mainly of the lonely lack of a relationship and hopeful seeking of a relationship.  MC Situation, well, I often have trouble seeing the relevance of past/present/change/future to anything in my stories; but the MC does seem to be worrying about possible change in a way no one else is, and she's at least as focused on the future as anyone else.

People are objects in the world not too much different from, say, buildings.  If I want to build up a person's confidence, that's a similar kind of activity to shoring up the foundation of a house.  If I want to mentally poison someone that's the same kind of activity as committing arson.  I am a creative problem solver, a do-er.  I write, I cook, I paint, all with the goal of solving problems by affecting other people's thoughts and opinions through my creations.  I choose my clothes to make a good impression because that avoids problems and sets the stage for a possible romance.  So, from the inside manipulation sure feels like an activity, just a mental one rather than a physical one.  Now, all that aside I understand that Dramatica isn't drawing the same distinction there that I want to.

They haven't analyzed soulmates or come to this conclusion logically, it's a belief made out of mostly enthusiasm and romanticism, similar to hero-worship.

Thus the questionnaire, because she wants to know everything about this guy before she commits to meeting him as a potential soulmate.\n\n[In reference to the statement \"the man was not really giving the woman good advice all along, from the reports.]  The IC has various opinions different from the MC's. He thinks soulmates are the best thing ever [100% good], and two soulmates should unquestionably be together, as described above. He also thinks women are generally lovely and nice, and would not normally suspect a new woman he met of having bad personality traits. He thinks \"love is all we need\" [thus children are not needed, not part of a romantic ideal]. He exemplifies living a calm, content be-er lifestyle in romance town, and it's clear he would want the MC to settle down into that life next to him (I'm remembering that illustration of the meditating be-er in the dramatica comic book.) He has no secrets and exemplifies that kind of straightforwardness and confidence that nothing bad will happen and there's no reason he should try to manipulate anyone or anything because everything will turn out fine on its own. His thinking too is simple and if he knew all the MC's thoughts he would regard them as overly complicated and overly paranoid.  [But this difference is the same reason why each is charming and magnetically appealing to the other; like city mouse and country mouse they are opposites which attract.  Each is strong where the other is weak, thus they could be a powerful team.]", "group_id": 2515, "id": 2481944}, {"user_id": 36525, "stars": [], "topic_id": 46791, "date_created": 1320129101.1455581, "message": "Sorry for that flood, I'm done now until someone asks me a question.", "group_id": 2515, "id": 2482112}, {"user_id": 36525, "stars": [], "topic_id": 46791, "date_created": 1320129055.6369951, "message": "Uh oh, found some I missed answering the first time!  MikeDerk wrote \"Back to this: \" But that aside she is attempting to check the least likely, most daydreamy option off her list first.

Time of day is a side factor - it wouldn't work so well to try to go to a bar to pick someone up in the middle of the day.\"\n\nHere's what I find really interesting about how you think about story. I agree that the time of day plays a huge role, and that makes sense. But why would doing the \"least likely, most daydreamy option\" ever be something anyone pursues?\n\nThink about it -- we need to end a war. Would the President ever try the least likely thing?\n\nThe Protagonist *wants to accomplish their goal* and all of their actions should be about that and only that.\"\n\nTo answer this, Omilla is what's called a \"completist\".  Basically her goal is NOT to find the first option that works.  Her goal is to survey all the options, do an impact study, then pick the best.  This might be a function of her being intuitive/female mental sex.  That's about holistic balance, and how can you balance a complicated situation without fully understanding all the factors and possibilities first?  This is the same reason she is town between the baby she originally wanted and the soulmate she found out she could get.  She decides having both is the best possible option, she sneaks and delays and maneuvers carefully to try to get both, but eventually she reluctantly accepts that there is no acceptable way to have her cake and eat it too, she has to pick one, and the baby is the one she needs to pick to be true to herself.\n\nAnd finally I get to sam_potter's recent comment \"I have to say this is very frustrating. It seems to me Mike is trying to get you to pin down some solid answers in at least one throughline and it seems that you just keep dancing around it. You are a very good natured person so I know it is not evasive.\"  Thank you for thinking I am good natured.  This all frustrates me too.  It is my impression that I am answering the questions, so I don't understand how they are not answered already.  Perhaps the issue is that I see everything within a story concept as being related to everything else.  It is natural to me to try to explain something by describing how it connects to other things.  But, I can see how this can seem like skipping around from topic to topic or dancing around a question.\n\nI can try again with MikeDerk's two most recent questions?  First question was what is Varan's personal problem.  In the most simple way I can say it, Varan's problem is that he lives an unexamined life.  He is letting Omilla skip through his fingers from their first in-person meeting because he isn't suspicious/inquiring/investigative/thoughtful, whatever you want to call it.  There are all these clues around him that things aren't quite right, and he doesn't notice them or dismisses them.  He has too much faith/idealism or too little awareness/perception, I see these as two sides of the same coin.\n\nSecond question, what about Varan tempts Omilla not to have a baby.  The idea of a grand romance with a soulmate is flashier than the idea of being a mother.  Varan has this mental image of a romantic ideal life where it is just him and his soulmate having great sex and pampering each other and living happily ever after.  He exemplifies thoughtless elegant simplicity and she knows she could join him in this fairy-tale world where life would be prettier and easier than making hard choices and becoming a single mother.  But it's like a shiny wax apple compared to a lumpy but nutritious real apple.  Or like a long-term body-building plan vs. steroids.

We can call them Strategist!Omilla and Idealist!Omilla.  The strategist is the protagonist and the idealist is the MC, if I understand correctly how we are dividing her different sides into throughlines.\n\nIdealist!Omilla says: Wow I would love to have a baby and be a good mommy, that would make me happy.\nStrategist!Omilla says: BUT the guys here in town demonstrably don't care for me, and in this town everyone sticks their nose in everyone else's business.  If I sleep with one of these guys just to get pregnant not only will it be an unsatisfactory experience, but he or his friends or relatives or my friends or relatives might try to force us to be a couple or criticize us for creating a child without being married, further making it an unpleasant experience for both me and the child in the future.  THEREFORE I will go to romance town, get pregnant there by a higher quality guy, not tell that guy about the pregnancy, then come home and not tell anyone about the guy.  I will have controlled the situation to avoid a lot of sources of unpleasantness, and in doing so protected both myself and my child.\n\nThat was probably too wordy, I'll simplify.\nIdealist!Omilla wants a baby so she can be a mother.  BUT Strategist!Omilla forsees that doing this in her town with a local guy will cause a bad experience for her&child in the future.  THEREFORE Strategist!Omilla decides to avoid this problem by going to Romance Town and stifling information about the conception so no one (antagonists?) has enough to cause trouble.  BUT Varan (as contagonist?) via his soulstone says: Psst, you can have a soulmate, that will make you happy.  Idealist!Omilla wants to be happy and is tempted by the idea that being a mother and a beloved would make her even more happy than just being a mother.  BUT a soulmate is not what Omilla is looking for, there's far too much commitment/obligation involved; Strategist!Omilla objects to the riskiness of giving someone the information that she is supposedly his soulmate.  This again could lead to a bad experience.  THEREFORE Strategist!Omilla decides to investigate the man without revealing herself to him as his potential soulmate.

Children have been excluded from this vision as they seem like an unnecessary complication that interferes in the pure passion and romance between two soulmates.  His recent interaction with the disguised Omilla made no impact on the fact that he was contentedly waiting for his soulmate, despite the fact that she acted a bit suspicious and there was at least one clue there he could have picked up on.  BUT, now a woman, apparently not his soulmate, approaches him and all but begs him to be her lover.  He feels drawn to her in the same way he always imagined he would feel drawn toward a soulmate.  So, even if they aren't true soulmates, he decides it's good enough for the moment and becomes her lover and acts lovingly toward her.

BUT he discovers that she is pregnant and that she knew she was his soulmate but decided to reject him after interviewing him in disguise.  IN RESPONSE he realizes he needs to find out why she feared becoming his soulmate.  He continues his new active behavior by questioning her, pressing her to communicate the whole truth to him.  IN RESPONSE she explains everything, tells him she does love him and would like to be with him, but being a mother was her deepest want and he can only be with her if he doesn't try to get between her and her child in any way.  BUT he says if she would have told him in the first place that she really loved and wanted children he would have been happy to give her one and raise it with her.

(It's like finally getting to open a christmas present!)  The Main vs. Impact Story Character report is one of my favorites because I always find it to give me a vivid basic idea of what the story is like.  Here it says, \"The MC evaluates Impulsive Responses in terms of Worth and Value.\"  That seems like a pretty good description for Idealist!Omilla and Strategist!Omilla, who have decided that they must have the high-worth experience of becoming a mother, and are trying to feel out a high-quality method of accomplishing this which will make Omilla happy without being too risky.  \"The IC is concerned with How Things Are Changing in how this relates to Fantasy and Fact.\"  That sounds like Varan's focus on how well his life is progressing at becoming more or less like his vision of himself as a loving soulmate.  \"The MC advances via Value but is held back by Ability.\"  Value here is Strategist!Omilla's skill at focusing on accomplishing the pregnancy by finding a good babydaddy.  Ability is... darn I've forgotten.

I read the book then (would have rated it about 7 out of 10, from the very beginning there were parts I didn't really agree with but tried to go along with for the sake of experiment.  I played with the program for a while, approached it from the Story Guide, answering all the questions as best I could for the novel I wanted to write then, Kissing Dragons.  But that had 4 viewpoint characters and I had a much less clear idea of the plot than I started with here.  I could not get a workable storyform and eventually gave up in frustration and moved on.\n\nBut two or three years later I was reminded of Dramatica, and decided to make another stab at figuring it out with a different novel idea.  That time I found the Additional Materials section on the Dramatica website, so I got to read the comic book and printed out charts.  I read the original theory book again, and joined the mailing list.  That's the first time I heard \"that might be possible in some non-western version of Dramatica\" as a comment on what I wanted to do then, which was break the way domains are required to be assigned in dynamic pairs.  Another reaction was \"maybe you need multiple storyforms for this, but I couldn't tell you how many or how the story is divided between them.\"  In retrospect I agree with that; a 600 page novel just has more content, more acts, than a single Dramatica storyform.  I also printed out all the terms and their definitions, color-coded, and tried to arrange them into an outline by hand.  This is still for me one of the most easy and functional ways to use Dramatica, though I do it on the computer now.  At any rate I eked as much functionality as I could out of Dramatica for that particular story concept, but again was frustrated that there was no real way to make them compatible and extremely frustrated by the fact that there was no way to examine some of the things the software was doing internally when one choice determined another.\n\nAnother two years or so later I came back again.  The Instant Dramatica applet had appeared along with Dramatica for screenwriters, and everyone was discussing PRCO and Z-patterns, which I hadn't heard about previously.  I read up on those and the other bits of \"lost theory\" and the original patent for the program.  In the intervening time I had made big changes to the Kissing Dragons concept, to the point where it had a clear MC/Guardian, a clear IC/Protagonist, a clear Sidekick, and a clear Antagonist.  Still did not get a satisfactory througline assignment for it.\n\nI participated in the Mulan storyforming group activity, and the one for the crazy villain.  Made the Big 4 workflow thingy.  I tried to get the idea of Dramatica Cards going but there turned out to be no way to produce them for less than $20 a pack, which is absurd.  Had a different story idea, Alien Archeology Movie, and tried to make that work in Dramatica.  Interesting thing about that one is it actually had clear involvement of the Situation signposts, which is usually what I look at and think wtf does this have to do with anything in my story?  Started writing an article/walkthrough about developing an erotic romance halfway using Dramatica.  But the more progress I made at being able to adapt, i.e. hack, Dramatica to make it work for my needs and abilities, the more negative responses I got whenever I wanted to share and discuss my efforts with others.  Which brings us up to the big argument here on Convore earlier in the year.\n\nThen fastforward to this thread, this story idea was originally more complicated but I stripped it down to it's simplest possible synopsis for a different purpose on another writing forum.  When I looked at the result I though, this is the absolute bare-bones simplest story idea I'd ever want to develop, there are only two freaking characters and it's obvious which is the MC; if Dramatica can't handle this wtf could it handle?  Nothing about it should be too difficult for a group of Dramatica users of varying experience, and the results of them developing it in Dramatica could potentially be very helpful and educational not just to me but to anyone struggling with Dramatica.  So my original intent was to donate this synopsis to be made into a walkthrough by others, I never wanted to be a major player in developing the story.  But first it was just Sam, and I didn't want to let his thoughts go without a response, that would be a pity.  Then you joined, Mike, and I was being personally asked questions, there's no way I could have withdrawn and still had a walkthrough get made with me as a spectator.\n\nAt any rate, I could go back and read the original theory book again.  That would cost me nothing but a little bit of time and boredom.

I thought we had successfully decided on a storyform for it.  Do you think the storyform I decided to go with is wrong for the story somehow?\n\nAlthough I'm boggling over the idea of not knowing what a viewpoint character is, maybe that's just a novel vs. screenplay thing. In a novel or short story a viewpoint character is any character who you follow around and get insight into their thoughts for one or more scenes of a novel. When I first encountered the Dramatica concept of MC my first thought was, oh ok, they mean the primary viewpoint character, the one who gets the most \"screen time\".  My point with mentioning the four viewpoint characters is that it was a terrible first concept to try to use to explore how Dramatica works, as is anything with multiple storyforms.  If it had actually only had one storyform it would have been ok, but I don't think it did.  Has nothing to do with the story being \"wrong\" just \"Any story with multiple storyforms is ill-suited to Dramatica\", or \"Dramatica is ill suited to any story with multiple storyforms.\"  And it's always a bad idea for a beginner to try to apply any system to something it's not suited to.\n\nWhy exactly do you assume that all my initial disagreements with Dramatica were/are possible to sort out, or that disagreeing with some aspects of it would prevent me from using or discussing the system?  I just don't see any reason to think that.  But no, I keep saying, I don't have any ambition to create my own system or try to win converts for it.  The point of this thread was to see Dramatica in action on a nice, simple, short like a movie, story concept well-suited to the theory and program.  Like one of those podcasts but building up from a new concept instead of analyzing a fully-created movie, which isn't all that useful to writers who are trying to go the opposite direction, from concept to storyform to outline and then finally to movie script.  It took waaay longer and had way more wrong turns, and you're saying you see the same wrong turns in your own storyforming process.  I won't even make a guess as to why that happens, but I bet every beginning and intermediate user of Dramatica has similar problems, and they would all benefit from a better guide to walk them through the process of going from concept to storyform.\n\nBack to me, I'm not an unintelligent person, nor do I have poor reading comprehension, or lack of experience with computer programs, or anything like that.  I might even be considered an ideal candidate for a person to pick up the theory book and software and learn Dramatica.  Yet I think it fails to teach new users how to use it.  The book has no focus at all on _using_ it to develop a story concept.  The software has the story guide, but that's not a really obvious starting point and the individual questions can be pretty confusing.  That's partly a problem of its age; every $10 videogame these days has a good tutorial, but in the 90s that concept was still developing.  Possibly the next version will have a great tutorial.  But meanwhile, the evidence that Dramatica is confusing to more people than just me is the existence of dramatica consultants and workshops and the general confusion displayed by various participants during the podcasts.", "group_id": 2515, "id": 2543444}, {"user_id": 36525, "stars": [], "topic_id": 46791, "date_created": 1320888326.9993479, "message": "More practically, could you explain what you mean by \"line up your drivers\"?

I think you are kind of missing the point that conjecture and theory are the same thing; guesswork about how something works that is difficult to test.  If it were tested and confirmed it would them become a fact or a natural law.  Theories are also usually not monolithic, but composed of many smaller assumptions; if one of the smaller assumptions is proved wrong it does not invalidate the overall theory, just requires it to be adapted a bit.  It's normal for there to be several competing scientific theories which share some elements, because fortunately that kind of theory can't be copyrighted.\n\nThis point that theories are not monolithic and have room for internal change applies directly to Dramatica.  Say Joe Smith for some reason decide that the Situation signpost names do not fit their sub-elements, and he renames them using a scheme that doesn't have anything to do with time.  That doesn't have any effect on the other 95% of the theory.  It doesn't make it not Dramatica or not usable.
