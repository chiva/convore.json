Luke, in the Dramatica example has Main Character Growth of Stop, and Resolve of Change. So, this means (as far as I understand it) that he lost a part of himself. I'm guessing the idea was that he lost the impatient side, his problem of not focusing on what he was doing? \n\nBut..... didn't he also gain a belief in the force, a belief in his own abilities and he learnt to follow his head, and to do what is right for him (to follow his path). So doesn't he also have Main Character Growth of Start? When thinking about it like that, aren't these gains more important than the losses?", "group_id": 2515, "id": 1103581}, {"user_id": 10814, "stars": [], "topic_id": 35880, "date_created": 1305817616.522459, "message": "Order is important.
