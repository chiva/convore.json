This can go in several different directions. Creating a story FROM theory and looking at a story/story idea \u201creflecting\u201d it against Theory.\r\n\r\nI will suggest that Armando in his book (Chapter 4) \u201cDramatica in Thirty Seconds\u201d and the next chapter might give a good example of \u201cfrom the perspective of Dramatica\u201d. He illustrates with a very sketchy idea, takes it through Dramatica and makes it a story. The throry to some degree precedes the story.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to take this approach to a story using the program but it sure doesn't happen in thirty seconds if you faithfully utilize the query system <g>.\r\n\r\nThe other perspective seems to be taking a story idea, working on it and then passing it through a sieve of Dramatica. Some members seem to follow this process as they \u201cre-write\u201d (or consider rewrite) a story.\r\n\r\nI don't think any approach is wrong nor right.

I'm interested in learning more about the theory, mainly because I believe it is necessary to get the most from the software. \n\nOne thing I don't see myself doing, is writing a first draft before Dramatica. I know this has been suggested a few times a possible good approach. For me, knowing the structure / understanding of the story are good first is important. So I tend to put together a very basic (synopsis) view of the story, use that to storyform, and then add my ideas of the story as story points. \n\nHowever, the problem I encounter is exactly how I should approach Dramatica using this method. As I normally have a clear idea of the story and an extensive synopsis, I usually feel that I am doubling my work by filling in the story points as well. The reason for my topic about Plot Progression was to see if I could get a better link between developing a story idea, creating a synopsis, then with Dramatica creating a storyform, and then using Dramatica to ensure the plot / structure are ok before the first draft.\n\nI am experimenting taking a synopsis and dividing it up into the appropriate areas of the plot progression (having broken the synopsis down into 7 parts), having already created the storyform, and then adjusting the various plot progression signposts and journeys to better match the suggested focus given by Dramatica.", "group_id": 2515, "id": 883294}, {"user_id": 7664, "stars": [], "topic_id": 33161, "date_created": 1304444012.8252251, "message": "@mp131 My personal belief is that story must be more important than theory. But I'm not sure how this works in practice. If I need a nuclear bomb, the bomb is more important than the physics... but I'm not going to get very far if I don't understand the physics.\n\nEither way, I don't think I understand the theory at all. Understanding the theory (to me) would mean understanding how one appreciation (female mental sex) affects another (swap it, spin it, carry it, leave it, etc.) Have Chris and Melanie even released that information?\n\nSo, what I do, is focus on the building blocks they provide.
