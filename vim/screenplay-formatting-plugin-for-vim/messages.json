Noticed a few (old) screenplay formatters for vim, was just wondering if anyone that may have used them (or is even familiar with them) could give a quick review on how they fare for straight up script formatting versus the two softwares mentioned above. Also, besides straight up text output, if either could save to FC's exchange format, well that would be pretty spiffy too.", "group_id": 100, "id": 1233775}]
