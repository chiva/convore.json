Series (Fumoffu/TSR), Legend of Basara (manga), Samurai X/Rurouni Kenshin - I love FMP simply because of the humor, but I realize it is pretty deep when considering real soldiers and ordinary citizens just how different our lives are and how do we find a middle ground for that. It ties into directly why I like violence (expressed in my video games like GOW). Legend of Basara is directly related to my love for RPGs and adventure stories. LOB is entirely about identity and sacrifice, which I love since the main heroine must sacrifice her love for her enemy and identity as a girl entirely if she wants to save the entire nation and her family's honor. As for Samurai X, for those who even dislike this series, I'm sorry but I can't be your friend anymore. Samurai X/Rurouni Kenshin is completely about redemption and holds a lot of ethical questions that if you don't look closely, you'll miss it entirely. The series ties into my love for distant violence and makes me want to become better.
