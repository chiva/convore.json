The whole idea is based on the premise that it isn't the individual's own will or idea to be 'good', but he / she should nevertheless be. This creates a tension between the individual's will and what is right, which leads to thinking doing bad things, or sin, is fun and enjoyable, and good and doing the right thing is dull and boring. If everyone adopted utilitarianism, it would just lead to everyone dedicating themselves to the 'general good', but would that really maximize happiness? People are different and are happy in different kinds of conditions, but how to decide on which groups of people's happiness should be prioritized?", "group_id": 175, "id": 324598}, {"user_id": 10087, "stars": [], "topic_id": 3972, "date_created": 1299863478.4224529, "message": "Only normative ethical system that would suit any situation that I could think of, would be aiming for highest understanding, knowledge and compassion.
