In particular, i'm interested in how we perceive  linear distance as well as logarithmic distance, or \"scale.\" We as humans are pretty bad at conceptualising anything that is exponential. The classic example of this is asking someone how tall a piece of paper would be if you folded it upon itself 50 times. The classic response to this question is something like five yards or 50 yards. The real answer to this question is if you were physically able to do it, the resulting stack of paper would reach to the moon and back.", "group_id": 175, "id": 1987595}, {"user_id": 6901, "stars": [], "topic_id": 44588, "date_created": 1315263027.1000609, "message": "As finite beings, the infinite escapes us.
