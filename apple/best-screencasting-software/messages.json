I've used all of them. Screenr.com: fast, easy, 5min cap, HD output & mp4 download, tweet-friendly, free, dig it! Gr8 app, Adam. // Screenflow: paid app, clean UI, EZ 2 use, record desktop motion+webcam video+VO, EZ 2 edit etc, I've even used it just for newscast-style videos as it was so easy to cut from \"talking-head\" to B-roll. Current favorite for screencasts needing more time than 5 min or editing of additional layers of video/audio/titling/call-outs etc. // Jing (PC&Mac): Free, EZ 2 use, dig it for fast upload to free 2Gb hosting account, then share wherever; can be private as compared to Screenr (all public). Dig it too. // Camtasia (Mac): cut my teeth on Camtasia for PC before I left the \"dark side\"; demo'd the Mac version a couple months back; the UI is somewhat easy to work with, and seems to include some features not in Screenflow. // All the above tools are good, and based on your project & budget, some will satisfy you, some won't make the cut :-) Hope this helps!", "group_id": 1295, "id": 449303}]
