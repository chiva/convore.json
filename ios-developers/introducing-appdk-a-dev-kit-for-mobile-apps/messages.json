AppDK is a Dev Kit for iOS developers and our goal is to make developing better mobile apps with as little effort as possible.\nWe're launching in a few weeks and we'll be happy to talk to iOS devs on HN to get feedback, suggestions or anything to try out. Hope to get feedback from everyone else here on HN, if you got any ideas that you want to throw our way free feel to email me AppDevKit at Google's Email Service.\nThanks!", "group_id": 427, "id": 712279}, {"user_id": 4253, "stars": [], "topic_id": 19865, "date_created": 1302973925.4135909, "message": "Looks great, but the page is a bit broken.
