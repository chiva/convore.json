Where are the actual full time positions? I do not live in an ideal place to be looking (West Texas), but I am open to relocating for a position if I found one. I would have thought there would be more around the Dallas area, but everything I come across comes from an agency that reposts the same ads month after month - most of which do not ever respond to any messages. I noticed people in this group discussed interviews and jobs, but how did you find a company to interview with in the first place?", "group_id": 427, "id": 1903397}, {"user_id": 29775, "stars": [], "topic_id": 44038, "date_created": 1313692353.8592229, "message": "There's also Appiction (http://www.appiction.com/) in Austin, but I'm not really familiar with anything that they've done.", "group_id": 427, "id": 1903635}]
