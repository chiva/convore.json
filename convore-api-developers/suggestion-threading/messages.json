I was thinking that it might be nice to change the site so that when you click on the reply button to a message instead of just @ tagging the person maybe there could be another field in the message that's like reply_to which would be updated with the message ID of the message that you're replying to.  The Convore site itself could use that or not, but it would be nice to expose in the API to give the option of showing threaded disucssion.  Or just leave it as a chat stream without threading.
