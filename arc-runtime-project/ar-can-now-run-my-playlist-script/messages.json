Actually, you know what? I would say that Arc/ar is now *better* than Python at shell scripts. Now all it needs is some nice juicy `import` ala Arubic and it'd be great.\n\n* [1]: Disclaimer: I haven't done any tests, so I don't know exactly how slow it is... it could be a problem with my script, but I don't really feel like testing it.
