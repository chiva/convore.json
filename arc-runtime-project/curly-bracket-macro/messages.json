[1 2 3] expands into (square-bracket 1 2 3) which makes it suuuuuuper easy to define custom behavior for the [] syntax: just write a macro. I think ar should do the same for {} so that {1 2 3} is expanded into (curly-bracket 1 2 3)\n\nHopefully I don't need to explain why this would be useful... but just in case you need convincing: this would let us write a simple macro to implement the infix-behavior described here:\n\nhttp://www.dwheeler.com/readable/\n\nOr we could have {a 1 b 2} expand into (obj a 1 b 2) if we wanted. Or we could have {} do something else entirely! By making this change, it would give us an awful lot of flexibility to change the syntax to suit our needs.", "group_id": 9739, "id": 1727921}, {"user_id": 25438, "stars": [], "topic_id": 42781, "date_created": 1311787025.603204, "message": "Sounds good to me!", "group_id": 9739, "id": 1732689}]
