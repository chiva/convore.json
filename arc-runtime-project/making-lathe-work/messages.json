I'm still figuring out all the changes I'll need to make to Lathe to make it work, and I'm going to continue putting in in-language workarounds before I go making patches to ar.\n\nAs a kind of midway progress report:\n\n- Trivially, ar has renamed 'ssyntax to 'ac-ssyntax, so I just put in a line to define 'ssyntax if it's missing.\n\n- The a.b:c.d ssyntax expands differently than I'd like it to for my Arc-3.1-targeting (do.foo:do.bar ...) patterns, as well as lots of (ns.foo:ns.bar ...) uses of the Lathe namespace system... which can just become (ns:foo:ns:bar ...). I've expanded my own ssyntax everywhere to make up for this, but it's always a little annoying. ^_^\n\n- I can't drop to Racket in Lathe in the same way (which is totally not an Arc compatibility issue). This is part of what I'm tackling right now.\n\nThis hasn't been committed to GitHub yet, and I don't plan to commit it until it passes all its tests. Some of them do pass, so I don't think it'll be that much longer to pin down the rest.", "group_id": 9739, "id": 1189748}, {"user_id": 25438, "stars": [], "topic_id": 36865, "date_created": 1306424204.698489, "message": "\"a.b:c.d ssyntax expands differently\"\n\nIs this a bug?  ar is supposed to (by default) work like Arc 3.1.
