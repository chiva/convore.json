After using angular momentum conservation of Earth + Sun, what I realized is that there is a momentum coupling between Earth spin vs. Sun spin vs orbital rate of rotation: 3 things no enough info to solve.\n\nWe have already examined the asymmetry in earth spherically oblate shape: does not yield seasonal variable but rather precession of axis over say, 22000 years (Kleppner).\n\nWhat is left is to examine asymmetry along the other axis: tidal bulge of the earth that is not aligned with earth-sun radial vector (due to the fact that earth's atmosphere cannot follow earth due to internal frictional effects).  Once again, this effect results in nonperiodic transfer of angular momentum from earth to sun, which in turn does not yield seasonal variation.  On the other hand, the tidal bulge effect can be seasonal if we consider how the atmosphere is affected by temperature etc..., but I am not sure if it is not negligible.  Am I overanalyzing?  What do you think?  I mean, it has to do with atmosphere heating & cooling seasonally, coz they mentioned global warming.", "group_id": 8199, "id": 490676}]
