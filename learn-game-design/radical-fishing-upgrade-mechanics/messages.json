Interesting how this game has no real endgame, you pretty much just unlock everything and can make money quickly to do nothing with it so you pretty much just stop playing. Definitely makes a good thought experiment as to how you could give the game longevity, perhaps using some procedural content or multiplayer aspects.", "group_id": 11586, "id": 2227738}, {"user_id": 40780, "stars": [], "topic_id": 45843, "date_created": 1317157919.3546901, "message": "Funny how much Radical Fishing is kind of what Upgrade Complete was satirizing. You have one single gameplay mechanic and then spend your points to upgrade to better ways to get more points in a vicious cycle but one offering some branches and variety along the way. \n\nThe fun of playing seems to revolve around a couple of things:\n\n1) Cashflow optimization - Strategizing about the best upgrade choices and fishing \ndecisions to maximize your upgrade speed.\n\n2) \"Trying out\" new upgrades. The novelty effect which usually only lasts 2 rounds but considering how often you get to upgrade generally leads to a continuous \"just one more game\" cycle.\n\n3) The Dodge/Reverse Dodge core mechanic of the fishing itself.\n\nI can only imagine they could easily tack on a few more tropes (I haven't played Ninja Fishing so maybe this has these) like Achievements (Jammin' - Caught 5 jellyfish in one pull!, etc) and Leaderboards. Maybe throw in the option to trade facebook credits for in-game money to skip to the upgrades quicker! So you can...earn money quicker?\n\nAlways love seeing how these very minimalistic games can toy with ideas around the core mechanic.", "group_id": 11586, "id": 2227728}]
